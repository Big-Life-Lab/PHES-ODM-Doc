The ODM model facilitates interoperable environmental surveillance and research by improving quality reporting data, enhancing data management, and supporting data provenance and sharing.\nThis documentation is intended for those who want to understand how the ODM model works, its organizational structure, and how to use it effectively for their program. It is also a useful resource for those who currently use a different data dictionary and wish to share their data with a program that uses the ODM. If you need to share your data with another program that uses a different data dictionary, this documentation can help you compare and create a common cross-walk between dictionaries. The ODM starts as a conceptual model that represents real-world processes through data elements and data relationships, which are common to all environmental and public health surveillance systems.",

    "text": "Quick start\nYou can get to know the ODM by imaging how to record a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 from a wastewater sample.\n\n1. Get oriented to the ODM tables where you record results\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Key ODM tables for recording data\n\n\nThe Sample report table (samples) and the Measure report table (measures) are where you record information about samples and measures.\n\n\n2. View mandatory and optional data fields in the tables reference guide\nYou can view mandatory and optional data field here: (samples) and (measures). ‘Mandatory’ means they are fields are needed to ensure interoperablity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat are ODM parts and how to find them?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the ODM, tables are an example of an part. A part name can be identified by its text style like this. The part identifier often follows the part in parenthesis, with a link to the part in the reference section.\nSo, Sample report table is the part name, and (samples) is the part ID and link to the documentation for that part.\nYou can find out more about parts on the reference guide section.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Try entering example data in ODM Excel templates\nKeep in mind, ODM templates are only examples of how to use the ODM dictionary to record data. Templates are available at OSF.io. The ’How to use the ODM” section describes how to enter information into tables.\n\nStoring sample data in an ODM template\nA sample (sampleID) is defined as a representative volume of wastewater (or other forms of water or liquid), air, or surface area taken from a site. The sample template stores one sample per row. The Sample report table has seven mandatory fields that are listed in the [reference[(tables.qmd#samples)] for the table.\n\n\n\nStoring measure data in an ODM template\nA measure (measure) is an observation or measurement of any substance, including biological, physical, or chemical substances, obtained from a specimen such including a site, sample, person, or population. Each measure is stored in the Measures table template as a separate row, following the “long” table format, which is the primary method for storing measures. For example, if you recorded PCR results for two SARS-CoV-2 regions, covN1 and covN2, you would record each measurement on a separate line. Alternatively, you can use a “wide” table format to store multiple measures in a single row or create tables that combine both long and wide headers. The European Union airport template is a hybrid template that exemplifies this (found in the “Airports” folder).\n(Video)\n\n\n\n4. Next steps\nIn addition to recording measures from samples, you can also record measures for a specific site, such as wastewater flow rate (flowRate), or the population served by the site, such as the Covid-19 hospitalization rate for a wastewater treatment plant’s wasteshed or municipality. Figure 2 illustrates the these three types of measurements: sample, site, and population.\nThe “who, where, and why” of these measurements is stored in contact tables, while the “how,” which refers to the measurement protocol or method, is stored in the protocols tables.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - ODM tables and ‘subway’ lines for storing measures\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\nWe hope that the documentation serves its purpose and that you find it useful in figuring out how to best use the ODM and its suite of tools. If you do encounter any issues or questions that do not seem to have an easy answer, please create an issue on our GitHub repository or consult our Discourse page.",

    "text": "Dictionary v3.0.0 Documentation v2.1.0\nThe ODM is designed to support a broad range of users in the field of environmental surveillance, including wastewater laboratories, municipalities, public health agencies, researchers, and citizen scientists. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive and extensible approach to data collection and management across the lifecycle of environmental surveillance, from sample collection and analysis to public reporting.\nThe ODM dictionary includes provisions for a wide range of biological, chemical, and physical properties, such as antimicrobial resistance, drugs, and toxins, as well as metadata for laboratory protocols that may affect measurement consistency across laboratories. The ODM supports laboratory information and management systems (LIMS) with measure to describe ensure data quality control and provenance.\nTo support the open science principle of FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), the ODM strives to make its data easily discoverable, accessible, and usable by all stakeholders.1 It also adopts an open-source approach, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance the codebase in a transparent and collaborative manner on platforms like GitHub.\nWhile the ODM is a complex dictionary, it includes tools to support its use, such as data validation, input templates, and SQL database definitions for data storage. Additionally, it supports collaborations among different organizations seeking to share and combine samples and measurements. As an open model, third parties can extend the model, such as the European Union Digital European Exchange Platform (EU4S-DEEP) data templates for wastewater surveillance at airports, European Union Digital European Exchange Platform (EU4S-DEEP) data templates for wastewater surveillance at airports, the CETO Epidemiologic platform, and Ottawa Automatic Data Pipeline to analyse qPCR data and transform it to ODM format.\nOverall, the ODM aims to support the evolving field of environmental surveillance and science by providing a standardized, extensible approach to data collection and management.",

    "text": "“Sets” and the rationale behind sets\n“Sets” are a way of grouping together different possible categorical inputs within the ODM. The purpose behind sets is to group options together so that users only need to check a few options from a drop-down menu, rather than scroll through a long list. Sets are also designed so that a single part can be used in multiple sets, which avoids the need to create multiple versions of this part for these different use contexts. For example, if you’re taking a measure of concentration, that measure will likely populate the unit choice drop-down list with units from the “standard concentration unit set”. Units in this set include Milligrams per litre, parts per million, and Percent Primary Sludge. Similarly, if one were measuring the amount of oxygen in a wastewater sample they would be offered units from the “dissolved gas unit set”. The units in this set include parts per million, and Milligrams per litre. You see here how Milligrams per litre is used twice across the sets, but exists still as a single part in the parts list. Unit sets are only one type of set, with the others being:\n\nAggregation sets\nCompartment sets\nQuality sets\nSpecimen sets\n\nDetails about these sets are their similar - but unique - applications can be found in the parts reference document. Importantly, “category sets” are not considered a “set” like these others. See the section below for an explanation of this difference.\n\nWhy category sets are treated differently\nOne of the reasons why “sets” are set up and organized the way that they are, is to allow for the re-use of parts in multiple sets. Category sets are, however, an exception to this rule because the categories that make up a category set are used in only one set. Furthermore, the general sets are needed for almost every measure or method (which require unit, aggregation, quality, and compartment information), while category sets are used only in specific circumstances for specific fields. These are things such as collection metadata (example: Sample collection category set), dictionary metadata and model architecture (example: Data Type Category Set), or more detailed types of certain methods (example: Nucleic Acid Extraction Category Set). Category sets are also a distinct part type, and more information about them can be found in the parts reference document.",

    "text": "The “what” and “why” of Specimen IDs\nSpecimen IDs indicate the level at which a measure is being done. This can be: a site measure, ie. a measure at a site such as temperature or weather; a sample measure, ie. a laboratory measurement on a sample, such as gene copies of SARS-CoV-2 per mL; a person measure, ie. a measure of something at the level of an individual person, such as a blood pressure reading; or a population measure, ie. an aggregate measure of a population, such as the number of confirmed cases of a given illness. While there is currently nothing in version 2.0 of the ODM with uses the person specimen ID explicitly, it has been included to allow for the possibility of storing individual-level data in a future version. The reason specimen IDs were created was so that there could be a single manner in which measures and methods are recorded, regardless of the level at which they were performed, while still maintaining the possibility to collect site, sample, and population measures as a distinct types of metadata.",

    "text": "The “what” and “why” of Groups and Classes\nGroups and classes, similar to sets, are ways of grouping together different measures within the ODM. Given that the ODM aims to be as robust as possible and has a very long list of possible measures, groups and classes were designed to give shorter lists of measures in the drop down lists by specifying details about the kind of measure that a user is recording. Groups and classes can work together to further specify what kinds of measures are being reported. For example, the group sarsCov2 contains many measures, but by specifying that the class is an allele or variant, the list of possible measures is pared down. Alternatively, class can be said to be non-applicable, paring down the measures in the sarsCov2 group to only be unspecified measures of the quantity of the virus.",

    "text": "Tables and table types within the ODM\nWithin the ODM there are three types of tables: program description tables, results tables, and look-up tables. These table types exist to differentiate the function of these tables and to highlight these differences to users. The different tables take different types of inputs and maintenance from users, so understanding the differences can be important.\n\nProgram description tables\nProgram description tables (represented in yellow in the ERD) are tables used to record metadata on the organizations, locations, methods, and appurtenance. These tables help to describe surveillance and testing programs, and are intended to be updated infrequently.\n\n\nResults tables\nResults tables (represented in blue in the ERD) are the tables used to record details on samples and measures. These tables record the main outcomes data and are updated daily, if not more frequently.\n\n\nLook-up tables\nLook-up tables (represented in green in the ERD) are the tables that are pre-programmed and pre-populated in the ODM. These hold information on sets, all parts, languages, and translation abilities. These are only updated by the ODM team in version updates.",

    "text": "Measures, Methods, and Attributes: Key parts\nWhile there are many part types, there are three main part types users should be most familiar with: measures, methods, and attributes. These three have parallels with the three table types, and the differences and details of these parts are useful to understand.\n\nMeasures\nMeasures are actually types of measures that can be performed. These can range from temperature to the number of gene copies in a sample. The measure, or measureID, can be selected from a drop down in the templates and it specifies the kind of measure you intend to record. The actual value of the measure is then recorded in the value field of the measures table, with units and aggregation specified in the unitID and aggregationID fields.\n\n\nMethods\nSimilar to measures, methods are types of methods that can be performed to accomplish a measurement. These can be diverse, ranging from incubation, qPCR, or nucleic acid extraction. The method itself (methodID) is selected from a drop down in the templates, specifying in general terms the kind of method the user wishes to record. From there, the value field of the methodSteps table can be populated by one of the inputs from the category set associated with that methodID. This provides a higher level of detail for a given method. For example, the methodID might be solidSep for solid separation of a sample. The value field might then be populated with cent for centrifugation, indicating more details about how the sample settling was done.\n\n\nAttributes\nAttributes are the largest category of part type, as these refer to most of the fields in the ODM. Attributes are fields for metadata within the ODM and range greatly in the use. They comprise everything from collection dates, to sampling period, to names.",

This field serves to highlight whether or not there is a quality issues with the sample or the measure. The quality flag also allows a user to specify the type of quality issue. This is managed through the use of quality sets, which are the sets that contain the possible quality flags for a given measure or for samples. The idea is that this provides data on any issues with a sample and an indication of the nature of that issue. Having data about the nature and presence of a quality issue is often not sufficient for decision makers who are trying to use and interpret the data. As such, there is also a reportable field which is a Boolean indicator of whether or not data can or should be reported or included in final reports and decisions.",

This allows for the recording of greater detail around timelines for especially long, multi-day analyses. For shorter analyses, which will likely make up the bulk of reported measures, the same date can be inputted into both fields. The idea is to have the reporting tables for measures be as robust as possible to allow for various kinds of timelines.\nFor samples, there is collDT, collDTStart, and collDTEnd. The first field is for the collection date and time of a single grab sample, so start and end are not necessary and the other two fields can be left blank. For composite or pooled sample, the start and end date and time for collection is crucial information to know. When these two fields are populated, the collDT field can be left blank.",

This field is left blank if the collection datetime start and end fields (collDTstart and collDTEnd) have been populated instead. Inversely, collection datetime start and end fields should be left blank if the collection datetime filed has been populated. Similarly, analysis datetime start and analysis datetime end (aDateStart and aDateEnd) are used to report the date and or timeline of an analysis for a measure.\nDate fields that are more related to data processing and labratory infrastructure are: the last edited date (lastEdited) which indicates the last time a table, or a measure or sample details, were last edited or updated; the sent date (sentDate), or date that a sample was sent to the lab from the field; the received date (recDate), or the date the sample was recieved in the lab; and the report date (repDate), or the date that the analysis results or measures were reported. These give a greater indication of how up to date data is, but also on the speed and efficiency of the pipeline between sampling and reported results.

When a translation for a given part is not available, the dictionary will default to the English term. The language look-up table stores linguistic and classification codes for spoken human languages, with the most recent ISO639 code being the language ID (languageID). In the translation table, the language ID is paired with every part ID (partID), along with the label (partLabel), description (partDesc), and instructions (partInstr) translated to that language.

    "section": "Recording protocols",
    "text": "Recording protocols\nWhen analyzing data from various sources, it is important to understand how the data was produced. The PHES-ODM recognizes this and includes protocols as one of its entities. To store protocols efficiently in database tables, several challenges must be addressed:\n\nProtocols are comprised of a collection of steps.\nProtocol steps can consist of two entries:\n\nThey can prescribe the use of a specific quantity of something. This can be described using the different measures found in the PHES-ODM dictionary and assigning them a prescribed value and unit of measurement.\nThey can prescribe an action. The PHES-ODM calls this a method.\n\nProtocol steps must be organised in the right order to convey the meaning of the protocol.\nSteps may follow each other, or they can be done concurrently.\nMeasures found inside a protocol specify the quantity of reagents, supplies and conditions involved in the realization of a method.\nDifferent protocols may use some of the same steps, but in a different order.\nProtocols may have steps that consist in one or several (sub)protocols.\nProtocols can be updated with new versions, or they can reference and build from other protocols.\n\nTo solve these constraints, the PHES-ODM stores a protocol (e.g., what it does, who developed it, when it was developed) separately from its constituent steps. These protocol steps are stored in the Protocol Steps table. The entries in the steps table are either methods or measures.\nThe protocol steps are linked together in their own Protocol Relationships table. Rows in the relationship table have four main attributes. The first is the protocol identifier. The three other attributes define a relationship between two steps in the protocol. The relationship is expressed in the form:\nsubject → relationship → object\nWhere the subject and the object can either be a protocol step or subprotocol. The available relationships (e.g., is_before, specifies, is_concurrent_with, etc.) allows one to organize the protocol in a more semantically meaningful way than by simply using a sequential order.\nThis flexible structure allows protocol steps and subprotocols to be reused in any number of protocols. The relationships between protocols, protocol orderings, and protocol steps are shown in Figure A.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Main entities and relationships used to represent protocols",

    "section": "Recommended formula for user-generated IDs",
    "text": "Recommended formula for user-generated IDs\nThere are 13 user-generated IDs used in the ODM. These IDs are necessary unique identifiers used to organize observations and metadata. The ODM is not opinionated about IDs, and users are free to use whatever formula or naming convention they prefer for these IDs. We have prepared a recommended formula for these IDs, however, which users are free to use. These are the formulas used by the ODM tools to machine generate IDs where one hasn’t been provided. For a quick breakdown, see the below table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser ID\nFormula\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAddress ID\ncountry code + province code + 2-3 letters of municipality + row\ncaOnOtt002\n\n\nContact ID\norgID + first 3 letters of role\ncaOnOtt002UniRes\n\n\nDataset ID\ndatasetID = orgID\ncaOnOtt002Uni\n\n\nInstrument ID\nfirst 3 letters of manufacturer + first 3 letters of name + first 3 letters of model + index\nfisHanHan\n\n\nOrganization ID\naddID + first 3 letters of name\ncaOnOtt002Uni\n\n\nPolygon ID\norgID + siteID\ncaOnOtt002UniCaOnOttOtt\n\n\nProtocol ID\nfirst 5 letters of name + protocolVersion\npmmov1\n\n\nProtocol Step ID\norgID + last 3 letters of part ID of method/measure\ncaOnOtt002UniIon\n\n\nQuality ID\nquality flag part ID + either the measure report ID, the sample ID, or measure set report ID that the quality report is for\nflagJcaOnOttOttawasite1202008021000covN1002\n\n\nMeasure report ID\nsampleID + part ID of measure + row number\ncaOnOttOtt20200802Covn1002\n\n\nMeasure set report ID\nReport ID of first measure in the set + # measures in the set\ncaOnOttOtt20200801Covn1002003\n\n\nSample ID\nsiteID + collDT/collDTEnd (not including time) + index (if applicable)\ncaOnOttOtt20200801\n\n\nSite ID\ncountry code (ISO) + province code (ISO) + first 2-3 letters of municipality + 3 first letters of site name\ncaOnOttOtt\n\n\n\nTo go into greater detail, the Address ID uses the recipe country code + province code + 2-3 letters of municipality + row. So it’s built using pieces of the metadata fields for the given address’ entry in the addresses table, and the row it occupies in that table. For example, the ID for an address in Ottawa would use Country Code = Canada, Province Code = Ontario, Municipality = Ottawa-Carleton, and lets say it’s recorded in the second row of the table, so Row = 002. This gives us an address ID of caOnOtt002.\nThe Contact ID in the contacts table uses the recipe organization ID + first 3 letters of role, again building the ID from pieces of the metadata. So if, for example, we are building a contact ID for a research associate at an organization with the ID caOnOtt002Uni, the contact ID would be caOnOtt002UniRes.\nFor the Dataset ID, we recommend it be the same as the organization ID (see below). So if, for example, we looked at our organization with the ID caOnOtt002Uni, the dataset ID would also be caOnOtt002Uni.\nInstrument ID uses the same approach of building using metadata, with the recipe of first 3 letters of manufacturer + first 3 letters of name + first 3 letters of model + index to generate the ID. For example, if we wanted to record a HandyStep S Repeating Pipetter (name), manufactured by Fisherbrand, and is of the model HandyStep S Mechanical, the recommended ID that is generated would be fisHanHan.\nOur recommended recipe for Organization ID uses the address ID for an organization (see above for explanation) + the first 3 letters of the name. So if the organization in Ottawa described in the address ID section was the University of Ottawa, the ID would be caOnOtt002Uni.\nFor the Polygon ID, the recipe uses associated IDs to generate the final product. Specifically, we recommend organization ID + site ID. So for a polygon managed by an organization using the ID caOnOtt002Uni and covering a site with the ID caOnOttOtt, for example, the polygon ID would be caOnOtt002UniCaOnOttOtt.\nThe Protocol ID is generated using the first 5 letters of the name + the protocol version. For example, if using generating a protocol ID for a first version of a protocol called “PMMoV Process”, the ID would be pmmov1.\nFor the Protocol step ID, we recommend constructing combining the organization ID + last 3 letters of the part ID for the method or measure used in the step. For example, a nucleic acid extraction method (partID = extraction) step from our university of Ottawa example lab with the organization ID caOnOtt002Uni would generate the protocol step ID of caOnOtt002UniIon.\nQuality ID ia generated using the recipe of part ID for the given quality flag + either the measure report ID, the sample ID, or measure set report ID for which the quality report is being generated. Generating an example, if we are reporting the qulaity flag J - Weak signal extrapolation (partID = flagJ) for a measure report with the ID caOnOttOttawasite1202008021000covN1002, we get the quality ID of flagJcaOnOttOttawasite1202008021000covN1002.\nThe Measure Report ID is built using sampleID + part ID of measure + row number. For example, taking a measure of the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene region (partID = covN1) from a sample with the ID caOnOttOtt20200801, recorded in the second row of the table, we get the measure report ID of caOnOttOtt20200802Covn1002.\nThe recommended recipe to generate a Measure Set Report ID is to use the Measure Report ID of the first measure in the set + the number of measures in the set. So for a set of 3 measures that starts with the same SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene region measure as described above (caOnOttOtt20200801Covn1002), you get the measure set report ID of caOnOttOtt20200801Covn1002003.\nSample ID is generated by combining the siteID for the sample + the collection Datetime OR the end of collection datetime fields (excluding the time and only using the date) + the index value (if applicable). So for a composite sample taken at a site with the ID caOnOttOtt, which finished collection on 2020-08-01 10:00:00, with no index, the sample ID would be caOnOttOtt20200801.\nLastly, a Site ID can be generated by combining the country code (ISO) for the site + the province code (ISO) for the site + first 2-3 letters of municipality + 3 first letters of site name. So to generate a site ID for the wastewater treatment plant in Ottawa, Canada, we would take the ISO code for Canada (ca), for Ontario (on), The first three letters of Ottawa-Carleton (Ott) and the first three letters of the site name, where the name is Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre (Rob). This gives us the recommended site ID of caOnOttRob.",

    "text": "1) How to use templates\nODM Excel report templates provide you with an easy way to enter your wastewater and other environmental data into the relevant PHES-ODM tables (more information about the tables can be found in the getting-to-know section). The templates also serve as an interactive way to get to know the ODM and can be found at the OSF.io PHES-ODM reference file folder.\nThe guides below will walk you through each of the report templates. In these guides, “field” refers to a column in the template, and “entry” refers to a row of information that you entered. The guides also provide definitions and explanations for some terms; more complete information can be found in the Reference Guide - Parts document. If you have any questions or comments, you can post them on our Discourse forum.\nAs a starting point:\n\nSample report and Measure report tables are used for day-to-day reporting. You can record information about a sample in the Sample report table. Measures (or measurements) are recorded in the Measure report table. A measure is “measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance”.\nThere are three optional tables that support the reporting of samples and measures:\n\nSample relationships is used only when you have samples that are pooled or split.\nMeasure set report can be used to link measures together.\nQuality reports is used for detailed quality assurance and control reporting (you can, and should, record a quality flag attribute for each measure or sample in the Measure report and Sample report tables).\n\nTypically, there is a one time initial setup where you will need to enter information into the Sites, Address, Organization, and Contact tables.\n\nSites is mandatory and records information about where testing is performed.\nAddress, Organization, and Contact provide the contact information for sites and entities such as laboratories.\n\nThere are optional supporting tables, such as Protocols and Instrument, where you can use the templates to record information about how samples are taken and how measures are reported. You only need to compete these tables once and then update them as needed.\n\n-   `Protocol steps` and `Protocol relationships` tables are used alongside the `Protocols` table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther supporting tables include Polygon, which stores information about the sample shed, and Dataset, which stores information about the data custodian and owner of the data.\n\nThe templates contain four main types of fields; in these how-to guides they are colour-coded for instructional purposes:\n\nIdentifier and unique identifier (red): In these fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, Sample ID is used to identify each unique sample. An identifier can be repeated between entries, while an unique identifier cannot. There is usually only one unique identifier per template, and they correspond to the name of the template. For example, Measure ID for the Measure report template, and Contact ID for the Contact template.\nDrop-down and conditional drop-down menus (green): These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that you can either select or type in. In conditional drop-down menus, the values depend on what you entered in a previous field.\nDate fields (purple): Dates are entered in these fields and must be in the form of the ISO 8601 format: yyyy-mm-dd. All date fields also support entries for hours, minutes, and seconds: 2022-01-01T06:11:54 and 2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30\nFree form fields (blue): In these fields, you can enter your data in any format that you wish. Any restrictions will be specified in the relevant sections. Keep in mind, different measures may have different data types that cannot be validated in Excel. The data type of a measure can be checked in the reference list for the measure. For example, the data type for Sample temperature is a real number.\n\n\nConditional menus\nConditional menus use the FILTER function (which is present in Excel 2019 and later) and are only functional in the first three rows of their respective templates. In addition, the auto-calculation has been disabled. Thus, you will need to press the “Calculate Sheet” button, which is in the “Formulas” tab after entering the value in the field upon which the conditional menu is based upon; this button is outlined in red in the image below (the image is for Excel Online). For example, for the Measure conditional menu in the Measure report template, you would select a value in the Class field, press “Calculate Sheet” and then the correct values will show up in the menu of the Measure field.\n\nAll of this was done because, in an online environment (such as Excel Online), the code for the conditional menus work can cause the templates to run very slowly. You can reactivate the auto-calculation if you wish. For further information about how to expand these menus to additional rows and other aspects of the templates, see Notes regarding templates.",

If you chose to enter in a Class (column O), the drop down menu will contain the Measures found in that Class. As mentioned, you can also enter a value into Group to help organize everything. If you did not enter a value in column O, the menu will contain all possible measures.\nFor example, to find the allele measures for SARS-CoV-2 you can start by selecting SARS-CoV-2 in the Group column. Next, you select Alleles in the Class field. Then, in the drop-down menu of the Measure field, you will see all the possible measures that contain SARS-CoV-2 allele regions.\n\n\nColumn Q\n\nValue is where you enter the value of your measure. For instance, if you recorded an Environmental temperature of 20 oC, you would enter “20”.\nNote: While the value you enter into this field can be of any data type, each measure is associated with a specific one. Data types for each measure can be found in the reference documentation. For example, the data type for Environmental temperature can be found here.\n\nColumn R\n\nUnit is where you enter the unit of your measure. This is a conditional drop-down menu field that lists all units that are valid for what was entered in the Measure field. For example, if selected Environmental temperature in the Measure field, the only unit displayed is Celsius.\n\nColumn S\n\nAggregations is where you enter the aggregation of your value using a drop-down menu. For instance, does your value represent a mean, median, etc.\nWhat appears in this menu list depends on what you entered in the Unit field (column R).\n\n\nColumns T to AB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns U, V, Z and AB\n\nThese are free-form fields.\nIndex (column U) is used if you have multiple entries with the same values in most of the other fields; an example is when you make replicates of measures. If this is the case you can enter “1”, “2”, etc. in this field to differentiate them.\nMeasure license (column V) refers to the access and use licensing of the measure that you are entering.\n\nColumn T and W\n\nThese are fields which contain drop-down menus.\nReportable (column W) is where you can indicate if the measure should not be used for regular reporting due to quality concerns. You can record more details of the quality concerns in the Quality reports template.\n\nColumn X and Y\n\nThese are identifier fields that are used to indicate the organization and contact person associated with the entry.\n\nColumn AA\n\nLast edited is where you can indicate the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure set report template\n\nColumns A to G\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns A, B, D and E\n\nThese are identifier fields.\nReport Set ID (column A) is the unique identifier for this template, and cannot be repeated between entries. In essence, each value of Report set ID represents a unique measure set. This field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\nFor the rest, you can repeat the identifier between entries (if needed). For instance, if you are entering two different measure sets that came from the same organization, then the Organization ID (column D) will be the same.\nYou may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance you may have created Organization ID in the Organization template.\n\nColumns C and G\n\nThese are free form fields in which you can enter the indicated information. Name (column C) refers to the name that you have given to the measure set.\n\nColumn F\n\nLast edited is a date field in which you can enter the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\n\n\nYou have now entered your data in the Measure report and Measure set report templates, congratulations!",

The first thing you would do is copy the code from AF4 to AF5 (see below, all images in this example are from Excel Online).\n\nThen, to create the new menu, you would go to P5 (which is where the new conditional menu will be located). You would select “Data validation”, which is under “Data Tools” in the “Data” tab (it is outlined in red in the image below).\n\nFinally, you would select “List” from the “Allow” menu and then enter the following text “=$AF$5#” under “Source”.

Adding conditional menus in an online environment (such as Excel Online) may slow down the templates considerably.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting conditional menus\n\nThe conditional menus work by searching the partLabels column in the parts table that is included with the templates.\nIf you obtained an error with these menus check if any changes were made to the parts table.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates with menus (all templates other than the Measure sets, Protocols, Contact, Address and Dataset templates)\n\nPart IDs\n\nIn the main parts of each of the templates, labels are used in the menus.\nIf you wish to have the part IDs of these values, they are located to the right of the main template and, if applicable, the code for the conditional menus.

    "text": "For combined long- and wide-formats\nThe PHES-ODM is designed as a series of long-format tables, but it is our aim to be as robust and easy to use as possible. To avoid issues of incongruity when moving between wide-format data recording templates and the final long-format data storage tables, we have designed a specific series of formulae to generate wide-format column names (or wide-names) using the part IDs from long-format tables, headers, and values. This may, wide-names can be parsed automatically to reliably move translate data between formats without introducing errors.\nMany environmental surveillance and research programs use combined long- and wide-format tables. To account for this, wide-names can contain a “see header” part for each piece of their formulas. These reference the header they point to, promoting data readability for machines and humans.\nLet’s return to the first example tables from the start of this page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\ncompartment\nspecimen\nfraction\nmeasure\nvalue\nunit\naggregation\n\n\n\n\ndec 17\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n32.1\ngc/mL\nsingle\n\n\ndec 17\nwater\nsample\nliquid\nPMMoV\n16.2\ngc/mL\nsingle\n\n\ndec 17\nwater\nsample\nliquid\npH\n8.2\nunitless\nsingle\n\n\ndec 20\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n34.6\ngc/mL\nsingle\n\n\ndec 20\nwater\nsample\nliquid\nPMMoV\n19.6\ngc/mL\nsingle\n\n\ndec 20\nwater\nsample\nliquid\npH\n7.9\nunitless\nsingle\n\n\n\nThis is long-format data, and I’ve added some additional columns to record the fraction analyzed, the compartment, the specimen, etc. Now if we were to move to a wide-format, we could use the formulae described above and generate this kind of table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nwat_sa_ liq_covN1_ gcMl_sin_ NR\nwat_sa_ liq_pmmov_ gcMl_sin_ NR\nwat_sa_ liq_pH_ unitless_ sin_NR\n\n\n\n\ndec 17\n32.1\n16.2\n8.2\n\n\ndec 20\n34.6\n19.6\n7.9\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at an example of a mixed long- and wide-format table. Something like this might arise where the initial table was developed for ODM long-format, but ultimately it was decided that the program wanted to record multiple measures in a single row. For this, we have what looks like standard ODM long-format for the first eight columns, but then the wide-format for the last two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\ncompartment\nspecimen\nfraction\nmeasure\nvalue\nunit\naggregation\nPMMoV (gc/ML)\npH (unitless)\n\n\n\n\ndec 17\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n32.1\ngc/mL\nsingle\n16.2\n8.2\n\n\ndec 20\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n34.6\ngc/mL\nsingle\n19.6\n7.9\n\n\n\nIn this example, you can see that compartment, specimen, and fraction analyzed are applied also to the PMMoV and pH columns, as well as the measure column. In these instances a measure of PMMoV where the fraction analyzed in specified in a different column would use the wide-name:\nwat_sa_hFr_covN1_gcml_m_value\nHere the hFr indicates by its placement and the letters used that the fraction analyzed is specified elsewhere.\nAnother example is for data is reported in long-format for one measure, but wide-format for all others. In this situation the fraction analyzed, the measure, the units, and the aggregation are all specified in other columns. Rather than simply reporting value as you would an attribute, you would use the wide name:\nwat_sa_hFr_hMr_hUn_hAg_NR_value\nto better link all the metadata pieces in other columns to this specific measurement. So to recreate the above mixed-format table with the ODM coded wide-names, we would get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmr_ report Date\nmr_ compartment\nmr_ specimen\nmr_ fraction\nmr_ measure\nhCo_hSp_ hFr_hMr_ hUn_hAg_ NR_value\nmr_ unit\nmr_ aggregation\nhCo_hSp_ hFr_pmmov _gcMl_sin_ NR_value\nhCo_hSp_ hFr_pH_ unitless_ sin_NR_ value\n\n\n\n\ndec 17\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n32.1\ngc/mL\nsingle\n16.2\n8.2\n\n\ndec 20\nwater\nsample\nliquid\ncovid N1\n34.6\ngc/mL\nsingle\n19.6\n7.9",

Finally, the attributes are listed in snake case. This wide-names is still machine readable.\nFor example, a wide-column name where sample collection period and collection number are reported together would be:\nsm_2_AND_collPer_collNum\nFor _AND_ style wide-names, the default separator must be a period (.). So for the is example, where we are recording the sample collection period and number together, a value of a 24-hour period with 12 collections would be 24.12.",

    "text": "Measure and method naming exceptions\nFor combined measures or methods, the ..._n_... approach is also used.\nFor measures, the formula is: compartment_specimen_fraction_n_aggregation(bool)_measure1_measure2_..._measureN_unit_aggregation_index_attribute, where all measures must share the same units and aggregation. For example, a column to measure the presence of “other” mutations, alleles, or variants uses the wide-name wat_sa_liq_3_OR_otherM_otherA_otherV_gcMl_m_value.\nFor Methods the use case is slightly more constrained. Protocol steps are rarely combined into a single field. Protocol steps using one or more measures which report a single value would be highly unlikely to exist. Protocol steps using methods combinations only work and make sense because the inputs are categorical and defined. The suggested structure for a protocol step using only methods (and no measures) would follow the formula tableShortName_partTypeShortName_n_aggregation_method1_..._methodN_attribute.\nFor example a column where one specifies the protocol step for either pcr or sequencing strategy in a wastewater program would be called ps_met_wat_sa_liq_2_OR_pcrmeth_seqStrat_value.\nIn instances of OR wide names, the values sets for the different measures or methods are distinct, and the sets information for the input can be used to determine which method or measure is being reported.",

Our tutorial here is just to write out what the wide name would be for each of these headers.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Headers in the Measures Table\n\n\nEverything in this table is an attribute, except for (eventually) the value field.

Keep in mind that for headers that are foreign keys (noted FK in figure 5), that the table short name used should be the table in which those attributes are a primary key.

There are three sections to the reference guide.\n\nparts – Parts are the smallest way of describing anything in the ODM. An analogy to parts of a car can be used to illustrate this point. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car, right down to every nut and bolt. There are over 900 parts, all listed in alphabetical order. Each part has up to 60 different attributes such as the part name and description.\ntables - The ODM database model has 21 tables in its full relational database. The full model is commonly referred to as “long” tables as it stores data with one measurement per row. The most important tables are the ‘report’ tables that are used for daily reporting of measures and samples.\nsets - Sets are lists or collections of parts. You can think of sets as the elements of drop down lists or categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDid you know that each part ID has its own URL?\n\n\n\nEvery part, table, and set has its own URL, that is created using the partID. partIDs are usually parentheses that follow a part, table, or set name.\nFor example, ‘airport’ is a sample shed category which would appear as: Airport (airport). The pernament link to the airport partID is, https://docs.phes-odm.org/parts.html#airport. Airport also is listed in the Sampleshed category set (shedCatSet).",

An analogy to parts of a car can be used to illustrate this point. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car, right down to every nut and bolt. Similarly, the ODM has a part ID (partID) and part description (partDescription) for every measure, method, and attribute. There are also part IDs for units, aggregations, and other parts. The part list is presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDid you know you can identify part IDs by their specific naming format?\n\n\n\n\n\nEach part ID starts with a lowercase character and contains no special characters. Parts have less than 12 characters, while part types such as units and aggregations have a maximum of seven characters.\nThe unique construction of part IDs serves several purposes in addition to generating valid URLs. Users can create wide table variable names (headers) using part IDs that are valid in all open software languages. ODM supports a standard method of generating wide variable names by concatenating partIDs with an underscore, _. For this reason, some part types have a limit of seven characters to ensure the total length of wide names remains less than 35 characters, which is the character limit length of some statistical language software. The wide variable naming method will be added to the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n16S Ribosomal Gene Sequencing\n(16rgs).

To ensure data provenance, the best practice in this example is to generate a new entry with the same measureID as the original measureID. The original and new measures are kept in the database with a date in the ‘lastEdited’ field for the new entry but not the original one. Some databases may choose a delete-and-replace approach where the original entry is deleted and replaced by a new entry. In this approach, the ‘lastEdited’ field indicates the delete and replace occurred.

Numbers are allowed but there no other special characters other than ``. `` is a reserved character that is used to generate a partID using a compoent or table attributes. A partID for a subComponent is automatically generated using attributes of a component. For example, the partID for the compoent `SARS-CoV-2` is `covid`. `Covid` can have many subComponents including different groups (Covid-19-al, Covid-19-va, ovid-pr (allele, variant or protein) or units and aggregatrions (i.e. covid-al-N1-mean-cpl representing ovid allele N1, mean observation of viral copies per litre of effluent).

    "text": "Table types\nDictionary v3.0.0 Documentation v2.1.0\nThe ODM database model has 21 tables in its full relational database. The full model is commonly referred to as “long” tables as it stores data with one measurement per row. Each table has mandatory and optional headers.\nThere are five table types:\n1) Regular report tables. The measures and samples tables are used for daily reporting of new measurements and information on sample collection. There are three tables that support regular reporting:- measureSets (optional) is used to link measures, sampleRelationships (optional) is used when samples are pooled or split, and qualityReports is used for detailed quality assurance and control measures.\n2) Contact information tables. The sites, organizations, contacts, and addresses tables store contact information for the testing site and the person who performed the testing.\n3) Protocol or methods tables. The protocols and instruments tables hold information on the methods used for sample collection or measurement. protocolSteps and protocolRelationships tables are used in conjunction with the protocols table.\n4) Other report tables. The polygons table stores information on the sample area and the datasets table includes information on the data custodian and owner.\n5) Dictionary reference tables. The parts table describes all elements of the ODM, including tables, table headers, measures, methods, categories, and units. The sets table stores collections of parts, such as units grouped together in a unitSet. The languages and translations tables support translations. The countries and zones tables standardize location information to the ISO-2 and ISO-3 to reduce ambiguity and free-text errors when populating these fields, while improving interoperability of location metadata.",

    "text": "Header roles\nEach table in the ODM has column headers, also known as table variables, fields, or entity relationship attributes. The header serves as the top row and contains the variable name.\nPrimary key (PK) - With the exception of the dictionary tables, all tables have one primary key. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each row in the table, meaning that a primary key value cannot be repeated.\nForeign key (FK) - Tables may have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key connects an entry to another table with a primary key. This allows for relationships to be established between tables, making it possible to link data between different tables.\nHeader (header) - This label is used in a table description when a header is not a primary or foreign key.",

In the measures table, examples of mandatory headers are the measureID and measurement date. The ODM validation toolkit can be used to validate data, and will return an error if a table lacks a mandatory header or if there are missing row entries for mandatory fields.\nAdditionally, there are special headers called mandatoryIf headers. These headers are mandatory if certain conditions apply. For example, the protocol steps table has row entries that are either measures or methods. If the row entry is a measure, then a unit becomes mandatory since all measures must have a unit. Therefore, units are mandatoryIf in the protocol steps table.",
