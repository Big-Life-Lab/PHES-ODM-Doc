    "text": "Introduction\nDictionary v2.1.0 Documentation v2.1.0\nThe Public Health and Environmental Surveillance Open Data Model (PHES-ODM or ODM) is an open-source data model and set of tools aimed at promoting global collaboration and use of environment and public health data. The ODM model facilitates interoperable environmental surveillance and research by improving quality reporting data, enhancing data management, and supporting data provenance and sharing.\nThis documentation is intended for those who want to understand how the ODM model works, its organizational structure, and how to use it effectively for their program. It is also a useful resource for those who currently use a different data dictionary and wish to share their data with a program that uses the ODM. If you need to share your data with another program that uses a different data dictionary, this documentation can help you compare and create a common cross-walk between dictionaries. The ODM starts as a conceptual model that represents real-world processes through data elements and data relationships, which are common to all environmental and public health surveillance systems."

Get oriented to the ODM tables where you record results\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Key ODM tables for recording data\n\n\nThe Sample report table (samples) and the Measure report table (measures) are where you record information about samples and measures.\n\n\n2. View mandatory and optional data fields in the tables reference guide\nYou can view mandatory and optional data field here: (samples) and (measures). ‘Mandatory’ means they are fields are needed to ensure interoperablity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are ODM parts and how to find them?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the ODM, tables are an example of an part. A part name can be identified by its text style like this. The part identifier often follows the part in parenthesis, with a link to the part in the reference section.\nSo, Sample report table is the part name, and (samples) is the part ID and link to the documentation for that part.\nYou can find out more about parts on the reference guide section.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Try entering example data in ODM Excel templates\nKeep in mind, ODM templates are only examples of how to use the ODM dictionary to record data. Templates are available at OSF.io. The ’How to use the ODM” section describes how to enter information into tables.\n\nStoring sample data in an ODM template\nA sample (sampleID) is defined as a representative volume of wastewater (or other forms of water or liquid), air, or surface area taken from a site. The sample template stores one sample per row. The Sample report table has seven mandatory fields that are listed in the [reference[(tables.qmd#samples)] for the table.\n\n\n\nStoring measure data in an ODM template\nA measure (measure) is an observation or measurement of any substance, including biological, physical, or chemical substances, obtained from a specimen such including a site, sample, person, or population. Each measure is stored in the Measures table template as a separate row, following the “long” table format, which is the primary method for storing measures. For example, if you recorded PCR results for two SARS-CoV-2 regions, covN1 and covN2, you would record each measurement on a separate line. Alternatively, you can use a “wide” table format to store multiple measures in a single row or create tables that combine both long and wide headers. The European Union airport template is a hybrid template that exemplifies this (found in the “Airports” folder).\n(Video)\n\n\n\n4. Next steps\nIn addition to recording measures from samples, you can also record measures for a specific site, such as wastewater flow rate (flowRate), or the population served by the site, such as the Covid-19 hospitalization rate for a wastewater treatment plant’s wasteshed or municipality. Figure 2 illustrates the these three types of measurements: sample, site, and population.\nThe “who, where, and why” of these measurements is stored in contact tables, while the “how,” which refers to the measurement protocol or method, is stored in the protocols tables.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - ODM tables and ‘subway’ lines for storing measures\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\nWe hope that the documentation serves its purpose and that you find it useful in figuring out how to best use the ODM and its suite of tools. If you do encounter any issues or questions that do not seem to have an easy answer, please create an issue on our GitHub repository or consult our Discourse page."

Parts are grouped into “part types”.\nBecause the term “parts” refers to every component of the ODM, “part types” are a way to differentiate between parts which have different functions and structures. The three most important part types are:\n\nMeasures: A measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance.\nMethods: A procedure for collecting a sample or performing a measure.\nAttributes: A description of the who, where, when, and why of environmental surveillance.\n\nSee the parts reference document for more details.\nThe are additional part types to support the dictionary including:\n\nAggregations\nAggregation scales\nCategories\nClasses\nCompartments\nDictionary support\nDomains\nGroups\nMissingness\nNomenclature\nQuality indicators\nSpecimens\nTables\nUnits\n\nFor information and details about all the part types, please see the parts reference document."

    "section": "“Sets” and the rationale behind sets",
    "text": "“Sets” and the rationale behind sets\n“Sets” are a way of grouping together different possible categorical inputs within the ODM. The purpose behind sets is to group options together so that users only need to check a few options from a drop-down menu, rather than scroll through a long list. Sets are also designed so that a single part can be used in multiple sets, which avoids the need to create multiple versions of this part for these different use contexts. For example, if you’re taking a measure of concentration, that measure will likely populate the unit choice drop-down list with units from the “standard concentration unit set”. Units in this set include Milligrams per litre, parts per million, and Percent Primary Sludge. Similarly, if one were measuring the amount of oxygen in a wastewater sample they would be offered units from the “dissolved gas unit set”. The units in this set include parts per million, and Milligrams per litre. You see here how Milligrams per litre is used twice across the sets, but exists still as a single part in the parts list. Unit sets are only one type of set, with the others being:\n\nAggregation sets\nCompartment sets\nQuality sets\nSpecimen sets\n\nDetails about these sets are their similar - but unique - applications can be found in the parts reference document. Importantly, “category sets” are not considered a “set” like these others. See the section below for an explanation of this difference.\n\nWhy category sets are treated differently\nOne of the reasons why “sets” are set up and organized the way that they are, is to allow for the re-use of parts in multiple sets. Category sets are, however, an exception to this rule because the categories that make up a category set are used in only one set. Furthermore, the general sets are needed for almost every measure or method (which require unit, aggregation, quality, and compartment information), while category sets are used only in specific circumstances for specific fields. These are things such as collection metadata (example: Sample collection category set), dictionary metadata and model architecture (example: Data Type Category Set), or more detailed types of certain methods (example: Nucleic Acid Extraction Category Set). Category sets are also a distinct part type, and more information about them can be found in the parts reference document."

    "text": "The “what” and “why” of Specimen IDs\nSpecimen IDs indicate the level at which a measure is being done. This can be: a site measure, ie. a measure at a site such as temperature or weather; a sample measure, ie. a laboratory measurement on a sample, such as gene copies of SARS-CoV-2 per mL; a person measure, ie. a measure of something at the level of an individual person, such as a blood pressure reading; or a population measure, ie. an aggregate measure of a population, such as the number of confirmed cases of a given illness. While there is currently nothing in version 2.0 of the ODM with uses the person specimen ID explicitly, it has been included to allow for the possibility of storing individual-level data in a future version. The reason specimen IDs were created was so that there could be a single manner in which measures and methods are recorded, regardless of the level at which they were performed, while still maintaining the possibility to collect site, sample, and population measures as a distinct types of metadata."

    "text": "The “what” and “why” of Groups and Classes\nGroups and classes, similar to sets, are ways of grouping together different measures within the ODM. Given that the ODM aims to be as robust as possible and has a very long list of possible measures, groups and classes were designed to give shorter lists of measures in the drop down lists by specifying details about the kind of measure that a user is recording. Groups and classes can work together to further specify what kinds of measures are being reported. For example, the group sarsCov2 contains many measures, but by specifying that the class is an allele or variant, the list of possible measures is pared down. Alternatively, class can be said to be non-applicable, paring down the measures in the sarsCov2 group to only be unspecified measures of the quantity of the virus."

These table types exist to differentiate the function of these tables and to highlight these differences to users. The different tables take different types of inputs and maintenance from users, so understanding the differences can be important.\n\nProgram description tables\nProgram description tables (represented in yellow in the ERD) are tables used to record metadata on the organizations, locations, methods, and appurtenance. These tables help to describe surveillance and testing programs, and are intended to be updated infrequently.\n\n\nResults tables\nResults tables (represented in blue in the ERD) are the tables used to record details on samples and measures. These tables record the main outcomes data and are updated daily, if not more frequently.\n\n\nLook-up tables\nLook-up tables (represented in green in the ERD) are the tables that are pre-programmed and pre-populated in the ODM. These hold information on sets, all parts, languages, and translation abilities. These are only updated by the ODM team in version updates."

These three have parallels with the three table types, and the differences and details of these parts are useful to understand.\n\nMeasures\nMeasures are actually types of measures that can be performed. These can range from temperature to the number of gene copies in a sample. The measure, or measureID, can be selected from a drop down in the templates and it specifies the kind of measure you intend to record. The actual value of the measure is then recorded in the value field of the measures table, with units and aggregation specified in the unitID and aggregationID fields.\n\n\nMethods\nSimilar to measures, methods are types of methods that can be performed to accomplish a measurement. These can be diverse, ranging from incubation, qPCR, or nucleic acid extraction. The method itself (methodID) is selected from a drop down in the templates, specifying in general terms the kind of method the user wishes to record. From there, the value field of the methodSteps table can be populated by one of the inputs from the category set associated with that methodID. This provides a higher level of detail for a given method. For example, the methodID might be solidSep for solid separation of a sample. The value field might then be populated with cent for centrifugation, indicating more details about how the sample settling was done.\n\n\nAttributes\nAttributes are the largest category of part type, as these refer to most of the fields in the ODM. Attributes are fields for metadata within the ODM and range greatly in the use. They comprise everything from collection dates, to sampling period, to names."

This is managed through the use of quality sets, which are the sets that contain the possible quality flags for a given measure or for samples. The idea is that this provides data on any issues with a sample and an indication of the nature of that issue. Having data about the nature and presence of a quality issue is often not sufficient for decision makers who are trying to use and interpret the data. As such, there is also a reportable field which is a Boolean indicator of whether or not data can or should be reported or included in final reports and decisions."

For shorter analyses, which will likely make up the bulk of reported measures, the same date can be inputted into both fields. The idea is to have the reporting tables for measures be as robust as possible to allow for various kinds of timelines.\nFor samples, there is collDT, collDTStart, and collDTEnd. The first field is for the collection date and time of a single grab sample, so start and end are not necessary and the other two fields can be left blank.

Inversely, collection datetime start and end fields should be left blank if the collection datetime filed has been populated. Similarly, analysis datetime start and analysis datetime end (aDateStart and aDateEnd) are used to report the date and or timeline of an analysis for a measure.\nDate fields that are more related to data processing and labratory infrastructure are: the last edited date (lastEdited) which indicates the last time a table, or a measure or sample details, were last edited or updated; the sent date (sentDate), or date that a sample was sent to the lab from the field; the received date (recDate), or the date the sample was recieved in the lab; and the report date (repDate), or the date that the analysis results or measures were reported. These give a greater indication of how up to date data is, but also on the speed and efficiency of the pipeline between sampling and reported results. Dates should be reported in day/month/year format to accommodate the most popular global convention."

The translation capacities are managed through the language look-up table (languageLUs), the translation look-up table (translationLUs), and the parts table (partsLUs). When a translation for a given part is not available, the dictionary will default to the English term. The language look-up table stores linguistic and classification codes for spoken human languages, with the most recent ISO639 code being the language ID (languageID). In the translation table, the language ID is paired with every part ID (partID), along with the label (partLabel), description (partDesc), and instructions (partInstr) translated to that language. The part IDs are linked to the full parts list which otherwise contains metadata that is coded in variables and requires no further translation."

    "text": "Recording protocols\nWhen analyzing data from various sources, it is important to understand how the data was produced. The PHES-ODM recognizes this and includes protocols as one of its entities. To store protocols efficiently in database tables, several challenges must be addressed:\n\nProtocols are comprised of a collection of steps.\nProtocol steps can consist of two entries:\n\nThey can prescribe the use of a specific quantity of something. This can be described using the different measures found in the PHES-ODM dictionary and assigning them a prescribed value and unit of measurement.\nThey can prescribe an action. The PHES-ODM calls this a method.\n\nProtocol steps must be organised in the right order to convey the meaning of the protocol.\nSteps may follow each other, or they can be done concurrently.\nMeasures found inside a protocol specify the quantity of reagents, supplies and conditions involved in the realization of a method.\nDifferent protocols may use some of the same steps, but in a different order.\nProtocols may have steps that consist in one or several (sub)protocols.\nProtocols can be updated with new versions, or they can reference and build from other protocols.\n\nTo solve these constraints, the PHES-ODM stores a protocol (e.g., what it does, who developed it, when it was developed) separately from its constituent steps. These protocol steps are stored in the Protocol Steps table. The entries in the steps table are either methods or measures.\nThe protocol steps are linked together in their own Protocol Relationships table. Rows in the relationship table have four main attributes. The first is the protocol identifier. The three other attributes define a relationship between two steps in the protocol. The relationship is expressed in the form:\nsubject → relationship → object\nWhere the subject and the object can either be a protocol step or subprotocol. The available relationships (e.g., is_before, specifies, is_concurrent_with, etc.) allows one to organize the protocol in a more semantically meaningful way than by simply using a sequential order.\nThis flexible structure allows protocol steps and subprotocols to be reused in any number of protocols. The relationships between protocols, protocol orderings, and protocol steps are shown in Figure A.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Main entities and relationships used to represent protocols"

    "text": "1) How to use templates\nODM Excel report templates provide you with an easy way to enter your wastewater and other environmental data into the relevant PHES-ODM tables (more information about the tables can be found in the getting-to-know section). The templates also serve as an interactive way to get to know the ODM and can be found at the OSF.io PHES-ODM reference file folder.\nThe guides below will walk you through each of the report templates. In these guides, “field” refers to a column in the template, and “entry” refers to a row of information that you entered. The guides also provide definitions and explanations for some terms; more complete information can be found in the Reference Guide - Parts document. If you have any questions or comments, you can post them on our Discourse forum.\nAs a starting point:\n\nSample report and Measure report tables are used for day-to-day reporting. You can record information about a sample in the Sample report table. Measures (or measurements) are recorded in the Measure report table. A measure is “measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance”.\nThere are three optional tables that support the reporting of samples and measures:\n\nSample relationships is used only when you have samples that are pooled or split.\nMeasure set report can be used to link measures together.\nQuality reports is used for detailed quality assurance and control reporting (you can, and should, record a quality flag attribute for each measure or sample in the Measure report and Sample report tables).\n\nTypically, there is a one time initial setup where you will need to enter information into the Sites, Address, Organization, and Contact tables.\n\nSites is mandatory and records information about where testing is performed.\nAddress, Organization, and Contact provide the contact information for sites and entities such as laboratories.\n\nThere are optional supporting tables, such as Protocols and Instrument, where you can use the templates to record information about how samples are taken and how measures are reported. You only need to compete these tables once and then update them as needed.\n\n-   `Protocol steps` and `Protocol relationships` tables are used alongside the `Protocols` table. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther supporting tables include Polygon, which stores information about the sample shed, and Dataset, which stores information about the data custodian and owner of the data.\n\nThe templates contain four main types of fields; in these how-to guides they are colour-coded for instructional purposes:\n\nIdentifier and unique identifier (red): In these fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, Sample ID is used to identify each unique sample. An identifier can be repeated between entries, while an unique identifier cannot. There is usually only one unique identifier per template, and they correspond to the name of the template. For example, Measure ID for the Measure report template, and Contact ID for the Contact template.\nDrop-down and conditional drop-down menus (green): These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that you can either select or type in. In conditional drop-down menus, the values depend on what you entered in a previous field.\nDate fields (purple): Dates are entered in these fields and must be in the form of the ISO 8601 format: yyyy-mm-dd. All date fields also support entries for hours, minutes, and seconds: 2022-01-01T06:11:54 and 2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30\nFree form fields (blue): In these fields, you can enter your data in any format that you wish. Any restrictions will be specified in the relevant sections. Keep in mind, different measures may have different data types that cannot be validated in Excel. The data type of a measure can be checked in the reference list for the measure. For example, the data type for Sample temperature is a real number.\n\n\nConditional menus\nConditional menus use the FILTER function (which is present in Excel 2019 and later) and are only functional in the first three rows of their respective templates. In addition, the auto-calculation has been disabled. Thus, you will need to press the “Calculate Sheet” button, which is in the “Formulas” tab after entering the value in the field upon which the conditional menu is based upon; this button is outlined in red in the image below (the image is for Excel Online). For example, for the Measure conditional menu in the Measure report template, you would select a value in the Class field, press “Calculate Sheet” and then the correct values will show up in the menu of the Measure field.\n\nAll of this was done because, in an online environment (such as Excel Online), the code for the conditional menus work can cause the templates to run very slowly. You can reactivate the auto-calculation if you wish. For further information about how to expand these menus to additional rows and other aspects of the templates, see Notes regarding templates."

    "text": "Detailed description\n\nMeasures template\n\nColumns A to H\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns A-C, and E-H\n\nThese are identifier fields.\nReport ID (column A) is the unique identifier for this template, and it cannot be repeated. You can think of each Report ID as representing a unique measure. The field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\nYou can repeat the other fields between entries (if needed). For instance, if you enter two different measures from the same sample, then the Sample ID (column C) will be the same.\nYou may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance, you may have created Sample ID in the Sample report template.\n\nColumn D\n\nPurpose has a drop-down menu. If you are unsure what to put, select Regular.\n\n\nColumns I to M\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns I to K\n\nThese are date fields where you can enter the dates associated with your measure in the format yyyy-mm-dd. Including hours and minutes is optional, but all date-entries use the ISO 8601 format. 2022-01-01T06:11:54 or 2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30\n\nColumns L and M\n\nSpecimen and Fraction analyzed have drop-down menus. In general both fields are optional, but both are recommended (see next point for the exception).\nSpecimen is mandatory when the data you are entering has more than one type of specimen. When there is only one specimen, the Dataset table records the specimen type. For example, if your Measure report table includes only wastewater sample measures, you can indicate this information in the Dataset table.\nFraction analyzed applies only for water and wastewater samples. You should record the fraction for all samples if the compartment type is water or wastewater.\n\n\nColumns N to S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns N and O\n\nGroup and Class help organize the Measure field by making specific measures easier to find (see the example in the next section). Both fields have a drop-down menu and are optional.\nLeave these fields blank if you do not use them.\n\nColumn P\n\nMeasure is where you select what is being measured. A measure in ODM is a “measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance”.\nMeasure has a conditional drop-down menu. If you chose to enter in a Class (column O), the drop down menu will contain the Measures found in that Class. As mentioned, you can also enter a value into Group to help organize everything. If you did not enter a value in column O, the menu will contain all possible measures.\nFor example, to find the allele measures for SARS-CoV-2 you can start by selecting SARS-CoV-2 in the Group column. Next, you select Alleles in the Class field. Then, in the drop-down menu of the Measure field, you will see all the possible measures that contain SARS-CoV-2 allele regions.\n\n\nColumn Q\n\nValue is where you enter the value of your measure. For instance, if you recorded an Environmental temperature of 20 oC, you would enter “20”.\nNote: While the value you enter into this field can be of any data type, each measure is associated with a specific one. Data types for each measure can be found in the reference documentation. For example, the data type for Environmental temperature can be found here.\n\nColumn R\n\nUnit is where you enter the unit of your measure. This is a conditional drop-down menu field that lists all units that are valid for what was entered in the Measure field. For example, if selected Environmental temperature in the Measure field, the only unit displayed is Celsius.\n\nColumn S\n\nAggregations is where you enter the aggregation of your value using a drop-down menu. For instance, does your value represent a mean, median, etc.\nWhat appears in this menu list depends on what you entered in the Unit field (column R).\n\n\nColumns T to AB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns U, V, Z and AB\n\nThese are free-form fields.\nIndex (column U) is used if you have multiple entries with the same values in most of the other fields; an example is when you make replicates of measures. If this is the case you can enter “1”, “2”, etc. in this field to differentiate them.\nMeasure license (column V) refers to the access and use licensing of the measure that you are entering.\n\nColumn T and W\n\nThese are fields which contain drop-down menus.\nReportable (column W) is where you can indicate if the measure should not be used for regular reporting due to quality concerns. You can record more details of the quality concerns in the Quality reports template.\n\nColumn X and Y\n\nThese are identifier fields that are used to indicate the organization and contact person associated with the entry.\n\nColumn AA\n\nLast edited is where you can indicate the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure set report template\n\nColumns A to G\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumns A, B, D and E\n\nThese are identifier fields.\nReport Set ID (column A) is the unique identifier for this template, and cannot be repeated between entries. In essence, each value of Report set ID represents a unique measure set. This field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\nFor the rest, you can repeat the identifier between entries (if needed). For instance, if you are entering two different measure sets that came from the same organization, then the Organization ID (column D) will be the same.\nYou may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance you may have created Organization ID in the Organization template.\n\nColumns C and G\n\nThese are free form fields in which you can enter the indicated information. Name (column C) refers to the name that you have given to the measure set.\n\nColumn F\n\nLast edited is a date field in which you can enter the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\n\n\nYou have now entered your data in the Measure report and Measure set report templates, congratulations!"

    "text": "Notes regarding templates\n\nTemplates with conditional menus (Measure report and Protocol steps)\n\nAdding more conditional menus\n\nThe code to determine the entries for the conditional menus are found to the right of the main template. Unlike the main template, the rows containing the code will not be alternating in colour.\nThe code is only present for the first three rows. If you want to use conditional menus for additional rows, you will need to copy the code to these rows as well as create the menus in the desired cells. As an example, pretend that you wanted to add a Measure field conditional menu to row 5 in the Measure report template. The first thing you would do is copy the code from AF4 to AF5 (see below, all images in this example are from Excel Online).\n\nThen, to create the new menu, you would go to P5 (which is where the new conditional menu will be located). You would select “Data validation”, which is under “Data Tools” in the “Data” tab (it is outlined in red in the image below).\n\nFinally, you would select “List” from the “Allow” menu and then enter the following text “=$AF$5#” under “Source”. The column and row indicators (“AF” and “5”, in this example) match up with where you copied the new code (“AF5”).\n\nFor additional menus, repeat the above steps. Adding conditional menus in an online environment (such as Excel Online) may slow down the templates considerably.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting conditional menus\n\nThe conditional menus work by searching the partLabels column in the parts table that is included with the templates.\nIf you obtained an error with these menus check if any changes were made to the parts table.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates with menus (all templates other than the Measure sets, Protocols, Contact, Address and Dataset templates)\n\nPart IDs\n\nIn the main parts of each of the templates, labels are used in the menus.\nIf you wish to have the part IDs of these values, they are located to the right of the main template and, if applicable, the code for the conditional menus. Unlike the main template, the rows containing the part IDs will not be alternating in colour.\nThe part IDs are present in the first 100 rows of each of the templates.\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting menus (not including conditional menus)\n\nThe menus are based on what is found in the lists tab that is included with the templates.\nIf you obtained an error with these menus check if any changes were made to the lists tab."

    "text": "Dictionary v2.1.0 Documentation v2.1.0\nThe reference guide is a technical description of the ODM parts. There are three sections to the reference guide.\n\nparts – Parts are the smallest way of describing anything in the ODM. An analogy to parts of a car can be used to illustrate this point. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car, right down to every nut and bolt. There are over 900 parts, all listed in alphabetical order. Each part has up to 60 different attributes such as the part name and description.\ntables - The ODM database model has 21 tables in its full relational database. The full model is commonly referred to as “long” tables as it stores data with one measurement per row. The most important tables are the ‘report’ tables that are used for daily reporting of measures and samples.\nsets - Sets are lists or collections of parts. You can think of sets as the elements of drop down lists or categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that each part ID has its own URL?\n\n\n\nEvery part, table, and set has its own URL, that is created using the partID. partIDs are usually parentheses that follow a part, table, or set name.\nFor example, ‘airport’ is a sample shed category which would appear as: Airport (airport). The pernament link to the airport partID is, https://docs.phes-odm.org/parts.html#airport. Airport also is listed in the Sampleshed category set (shedCatSet)."

If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car, right down to every nut and bolt. Similarly, the ODM has a part ID (partID) and part description (partDescription) for every measure, method, and attribute. There are also part IDs for units, aggregations, and other parts. The part list is presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know you can identify part IDs by their specific naming format?\n\n\n\n\n\nEach part ID starts with a lowercase character and contains no special characters. Parts have less than 12 characters, while part types such as units and aggregations have a maximum of seven characters.\nThe unique construction of part IDs serves several purposes in addition to generating valid URLs. Users can create wide table variable names (headers) using part IDs that are valid in all open software languages. ODM supports a standard method of generating wide variable names by concatenating partIDs with an underscore, _. For this reason, some part types have a limit of seven characters to ensure the total length of wide names remains less than 35 characters, which is the character limit length of some statistical language software. The wide variable naming method will be added to the documentation.\n\n\n\n\na1306s delta-variant gene target\n(a1306s). a1306s delta-variant gene target  Part Type: measurements  Domain: bio  Speciment ID: saSpecimenSet  Compartment Set: anyCompartmentSet  Group: sarsCov2  Class: mutation  Nomenclature: mutation  Ontology Reference: NA  Category Set ID: NA  Unit Set: geneticUnitSet  Aggregation Scale: seeUnitAggScale  Quality Set: NA  Reference Link: NA  Data Type: seeUnitData  Missingness Set: genMissingnessSet   Minimum Value: seeUnitVal  Maximum Value: seeUnitVal  Minimum Length: NA  Maximum Length: NA  Part Status: active.

First released: active. Last updated: 2.0.0. \n\n\nLast edited\n(lastEdited). The date the entry was last updated. Use lastEdited if an entry is updated. Leave lastEdited blank or ‘NA’ for the first entry. Updates can include additions or revisions of the entry for any reason. For example, a wastewater measure was repeated later with an improved method. You can revise the entry by updating the value and then adding the date the new measure was performed to ‘lastEdited’. To ensure data provenance, the best practice in this example is to generate a new entry with the same measureID as the original measureID. The original and new measures are kept in the database with a date in the ‘lastEdited’ field for the new entry but not the original one. Some databases may choose a delete-and-replace approach where the original entry is deleted and replaced by a new entry. In this approach, the ‘lastEdited’ field indicates the delete and replace occurred.

Numbers are allowed but there no other special characters other than ``. `` is a reserved character that is used to generate a partID using a compoent or table attributes. A partID for a subComponent is automatically generated using attributes of a component. For example, the partID for the compoent `SARS-CoV-2` is `covid`. `Covid` can have many subComponents including different groups (Covid-19-al, Covid-19-va, ovid-pr (allele, variant or protein) or units and aggregatrions (i.e. covid-al-N1-mean-cpl representing ovid allele N1, mean observation of viral copies per litre of effluent). A similar approach to naming subComponent is use for naming parts in a reprotTable.

    "text": "Table types\nThere are five table types:\n1) Regular report tables. The measures and samples tables are used for daily reporting of new measurements and information on sample collection. There are three tables that support regular reporting:- measureSets (optional) is used to link measures, sampleRelationships (optional) is used when samples are pooled or split, and qualityReports is used for detailed quality assurance and control measures.\n2) Contact information tables. The sites, organizations, contacts, and addresses tables store contact information for the testing site and the person who performed the testing.\n3) Protocol or methods tables. The protocols and instruments tables hold information on the methods used for sample collection or measurement. protocolSteps and protocolRelationships tables are used in conjunction with the protocols table.\n4) Other report tables. The polygons table stores information on the sample area and the datasets table includes information on the data custodian and owner.\n5) Dictionary reference tables. The parts table describes all elements of the ODM, including tables, table headers, measures, methods, categories, and units. The sets table stores collections of parts, such as units grouped together in a unitSet. The languages and translations tables support translations. The countries and zones tables standardize location information to the ISO-2 and ISO-3 to reduce ambiguity and free-text errors when populating these fields, while improving interoperability of location metadata."

The header serves as the top row and contains the variable name.\nPrimary key (PK) - With the exception of the dictionary tables, all tables have one primary key. The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each row in the table, meaning that a primary key value cannot be repeated.\nForeign key (FK) - Tables may have one or more foreign keys. A foreign key connects an entry to another table with a primary key. This allows for relationships to be established between tables, making it possible to link data between different tables.\nHeader (header) - This label is used in a table description when a header is not a primary or foreign key."

In the measures table, examples of mandatory headers are the measureID and measurement date. The ODM validation toolkit can be used to validate data, and will return an error if a table lacks a mandatory header or if there are missing row entries for mandatory fields.\nAdditionally, there are special headers called mandatoryIf headers. These headers are mandatory if certain conditions apply. For example, the protocol steps table has row entries that are either measures or methods. If the row entry is a measure, then a unit becomes mandatory since all measures must have a unit. Therefore, units are mandatoryIf in the protocol steps table."
