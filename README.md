# PHES-ODM-Doc

This is the repository for documentation to support use and uptake of the [Public Health Environmental Surveillance Open Data Model (PHES-ODM)](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PHES-ODM).

The documentation is built here, and then once finalized will be pushed to the website and the official repo for the full ODM project. The documentation built here is intended to follow the Divio approach of a ["The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation"](https://documentation.divio.com). This is comprised of *tutorials*, *how-to guides*, *technical reference*, and *explanation*.

- *Tutorials* are learning-oriented, with a focus on learning through doing. These are less about _what_ is being taught, and more about building confidence and developing skills.

- *How-to Guides* are problem-oriented, with a focus on answering a specific question or problem. 

- *Technical References* are information-oriented, with a focus on providing information on a given topic or piece. This gives an overview of an item, as well as common potential problmes.

- *Explanations* are understanding-oriented and exist neither to teach or describe, but rather to analyse, deepen, and enrich knowledge about a given system. This is not essential reading for users, but is available for users who are interested.

## Rough Outline for PHES-ODM Documentation

This overview is a skeleton, but subjject to change and review as documentation work advances.

### Introduction 
- Representation of wastewater in tables

### Tutorials 
- Using templates 
- Describing methods 
- Describing your program 

### How-To Guides 
- How to use templates:
  * How to report methods: text tutorial with images + narrated video (YouTube)  
  * How to report measures: text tutorial with images + narrated video (YouTube) 
  * How to report samples: text tutorial with images + narrated video (YouTube) 
  * How to report metadata: text tutorial with images + narrated video (YouTube) 
- Example data for each of the 11 report tables. 

### Technical References 
- Automatically generated documentation pieces across sections: 
  * Full parts list 
  * Tables 
  * Measures 
  * Methods 
  * Aggregations 
  * Units 

- The Entity Relationship Diagram (PDF + SQL) 
- List of tools:
  * Validator 
  * PCR analyzer 

### Explanations

- What are part types? 
- Rationale behind sets (why are category sets different)
- Rationale of specimen IDs
- Rationale of Groups and Classes
- Tables and Report table types 
- Measures, methods, and attributes
- Quality and Reportability
- Time periods for samples and measures. 
- Translation and language capabilities 
- Discourse posts ([PHES-ODM Discourse Page](https://odm.discourse.group/))
