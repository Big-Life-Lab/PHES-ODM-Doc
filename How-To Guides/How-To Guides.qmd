## How-To Guides

### How to use templates:

Below you will find a series of Guides that explain how to complete templates. In these Guides, "field" refers to one column in the template, and "entry" refers to a row of information that you entered. For definitions of others terms, please see <!--# link and/or provide title to page with definitions -->.

The templates contain four main types of fields and, in the Guides, they have been associated with a colour for instructional purposes: <!--# I continued the division and colour-coding of the fields from Vince's version.  I'm open to other ideas-->

-   **Label and a Primary Unique Label (Red):** Both of these types of fields contain values that are used to identify something and that you will create. In a Primary Unique Label, the value must be unique for each entry.

-   **Drop-down and Conditional drop-down menus (Green):** These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the options that can be entered. These options can be selected or typed in. In conditional drop-down menus, the options depend on what you entered in a previous column.

-   **Free form (Blue):** In these fields, there are no restrictions on how to enter your data.

In this guide you will learn how to enter Measures into the Measures template. As described in <!--# title of document and link-->, a Measure is a "measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance". For definition of other terms, please see <!--#link to "How to use Templates" section and page with definitions  -->

## Quick Start

Below you will find the fields that are mandatory for this template. You will also find some examples of entries of data, with all of the columns filled and colour-coded.  A more detailed description can be found in the following section, "Detailed Description".

**Mandatory fields**

|                                                    |                |
|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
|                 Measure Report ID                  |   Measure ID   |
|                      Site ID                       |     Value      |
|                 Analysis Date End                  |      Unit      |
|                    Specimen ID                     | Aggregation ID |
| Fraction analyzed (only if Specimen ID = "Sample") |   Sample ID    |

## Detailed Description

1.  **Columns A to H**

    ![](images/Col_AH_1.png)

    i)  Most of the fields in these sections require a Label, that, as mentioned previously, you will create. They can take any form that you wish and, for most of them, there can be repetition between rows when needed. You also may have already created these Labels in a previous template. For instance, if you're entering two different measures from the same sample, then the "Sample ID" will be the same and you may have already created this Label in the Samples Template. The only exception to all of this is "Measure report ID" (column A) which is the Primary Unique Label for this template and which cannot be repeated between rows.
    ii) The only non-ID related field in the section is Column D, "Purpose", in which you will need to enter one of the options from the menu.

2.  **Columns I to M**

    ![](images/Col_IM_1.png)

    i)  For columns I to K, you will need to enter various dates associated with your Measure. Any format is fine. <!--# Is this true? -->
    ii) Columns L and M ("Specimen ID" and "Fraction analyzed") have menus which contain the options that you can enter.

    Â 

3.  **Columns N to S**

    ![](images/Col_NS_1.png)

    i)  For columns N and O, you can find the in the menus the possible options for Group and Class, respectively, of the Measure that you are entering. If you are not sure of the Group and Class, you can determine this from <!--# Not sure what document to reference --> .
    ii) In column P, you will enter the Measure of your entry. If you chose to enter in a value in column O (Class ID), the drop down menu will contain the Measures found in that Class. If you did not enter a value in column O, the menu will contain all possible Measures.
    iii) Column Q is a free form field, where you enter in the value of your measure. For instance, if your Measure is a temperature of 20 ^o^C, your value would be "20".
    iv) In Column R you can find the possible units of your value in the menu. Using the temperature example in the previous step, it would be "Celcius". What appears in this menu depends on what you entered in the Measure ID column (column P).
    v)  Column S contains a conditional menu with the types of aggregation of your value. For example does your value represent a mean, median, etc. What appears in this menu depends on what you entered in the Unit column (column Q).

    Â 

4.  **Columns T and W**

    ![](images/Col_TW_1.png)

    i)  Columns T, W and X are free form fields in which you can enter the indicated information.
    ii) Columns U and V contain menus which contain the possible options that you can enter. Also, Column U ("Quality Flag") is a conditional menu which depends on the Measure (column P).

You have now entered your data in the Measures Template, congratulations!
