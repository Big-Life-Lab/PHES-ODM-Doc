# How to use the ODM {.unnumbered}

## How-To guides

## 1) How to use templates

ODM Excel templates provide you with an easy way to convert your wastewater data into the PHES-ODM format. The templates also serve as an interactive way to get to know the ODM. Below you will find a series of guides that will walk you through how to enter data into the templates.

In these guides, "field" refers to a column in the template, and "entry" refers to a row of information that you entered. guides will also provide definitions and explanations for some terms; however, more complete information is found in the most can be found in the reference section of the ODM documentation. <!--# link to Rusty's page with the definitions -->.

The templates can be found at the OSF.io [PHES-ODM project](https://osf.io/ynp6f "https://osf.io/ynp6f"). The they can be completed in any order. More information about the tables can be found in the [getting-to-know](TBD) section. Briefly,

-   `measures` and `samples` table the blue tabs and they are used day-to-day reporting of new measurements and information about how and when samples are collected. `sampleRelationships` is used only when you have samples that are pooled or split. `qualityReports` is used for detailed quality assurance and control measures (you can---and should--- record a [quality flag](TBD) attribute for each measure or sample in the `measures` and `samples` tables).

-   Typically, there is one-time initial setup where information is entered the tables with the yellow tabs. These tables include information about `sites`, `organizations`, `contacts`, and `addresses`.

-   There are supporting tables including `protocols` and `instruments` where you record information about how samples are taken and measures are reported. The tables are usually completed once and then updated when there are changes to the protocol. `protocolSteps` and `protocolRelationships` tables are part used alongside the `protocols` table. Other supporting tables include `polygons` where information is store about the sample shed and `datasets` which includes information about the data custodian and owner of the data.

<!--# Should I include an explanation regarding the "side content" in some of the templates (i.e. the code for the conditional menus and to convert the entered data into part IDs) or should I hide them in the template? -->

<!--# DGM: What about an 'explanation' section at the end of the document. This could be left to a future update. The section could describe how the spreadsheets work and how they can be customized -->

<!--# Should I include an explanation regarding how certain templates only have 3 rows active (because of the slow down caused by the conditional menus)? -->

<!--# DGM: I would put that in the future 'explanation' section at the end-->

The templates contain four main types of fields, each with their own for instructional purposes:

-   **Identifier, unique identifier and composite unique identifier (red):** In these fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, `Sample ID` is used to identify each unique sample. An identifier can be repeated between entries, while an unique identifier cannot. There is usually only one unique identifier per template, and they correspond to the name of the table. e.g. `Measure ID` for the `measures` table, and `Contact ID` for the `contacts` table.
-   **Drop-down and conditional drop-down menus (green):** These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that you can either select **or** type in. In conditional drop-down menus, the values depend on what you entered in a previous field.
-   **Date Fields (purple):** Dates are entered in these fields and must be in the form of the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html "https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html") format: `yyyy-mm-dd`. All date fields also support entries for hours, minutes, and seconds: `2022-01-01T06:11:54` and `2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30`
-   **Free Form Fields (blue):** In these fields, you can enter your data. Any restrictions will be specified in the relevant sections. Keep in mind, different measures may have different data types that can not be validated in Excel. Data types each measure can be checked in the reference list for the measure. For example, the data type for [temperature](docs.phes-odm.org/parts#temp "docs.phes-odm.org/parts#temp") is a real number.

## 2) How to report `Protocols`, `Protocol Steps` and `Protocol Relationships`:

In this guide you will learn how to enter Protocols, Protocol Steps and Protocol Relationships into their respective templates. As described in <!--# title of definitions document and link-->, a Protocol is "A procedure for collecting a sample or performing a measure". Each entry in the Protocols Template represents a unique Protocol. A Protocol is made up of Protocol Steps. In the Protocol Steps Template, each entry is one of these steps. Finally, Protocols and Protocols can be linked to each other. Each entry in the Protocol Relationships Template represents one of these relationships in the form, Subject - Relationship - Object. So, for example, to specify that Protocol Step A needs to be done before Protocol Step B, you would enter "Protocol Step A" - "is Before" - "Protocol Step B". <!--# is this correct? -->.

You can find additional information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns at the beginning of this guide ([1) How to use templates]) and <!--# link to definitions document -->

        -   Protocol ID (column B) is the Unique Identifier for this template, and cannot be repeated between entries. In essence, each value of Protocol ID represents a unique Protocol.
        -   For Dataset ID, you can repeat between entries (if needed). For instance, if you are entering two different Protocols from the same Dataset, then the Dataset ID (column C) will be the same.
        -   You may have already created the Dataset IDs in the Datasets Template.
    ii) Columns A, D to F:
        -   These are Free Form fields in which you can enter the indicated information.
        -   Source Protocol (column A) is where you can indicate the Protocol that served as the basis for the Protocol that is currently being entered. <!--# I'm not sure if this is an "ID" field or not -->
        -   Name (column D) refers to the Name that you have decided to give your Protocol.

        -   All of these Identifiers are either Protocol IDs or Protocol Step IDs and represent Protocols and Protocol Steps, respectively. This includes Protocol ID Container (column A), which represents the Protocol that contains the relationships that you are entering in this template. Note that none of these fields are Unique Identifiers and, thus, can be repeated between entries.

        -   You should only enter in a value for one of the two "Object" columns (column B and C); this depends on whether the Object of the relationship that you are entering is a Protocol or a Protocol Step. The same is true for the two "Subject" columns (column E and F).

        -   An example will be given in point (ii) below.

    ii) Columns D:

        -   This is a Drop-down Menu field, where you can select the type of Relationship that is being entered.
        -   For example, say you wanted to enter in a Relationship stating that Protocol Step A takes place before Protocol Step B in a particular Protocol Container. You would enter the relevant Identifiers in the Step ID Object field (column B) and the Step ID Subject field (column F). You would then select "is Before" from the Relationship field. Finally, to identify this relationship, you would enter in the Identifier in the Protocol ID Container field (column A)

    iii) Columns G and H:

         -   These are a Date field (column D) and a Free Form field (column E) where you can enter in the indicated information.

In this guide you will learn how to enter Metadata through a series of templates. Each entry in a template will usually represent what is found in the title of the template. For instance, in the Organizations template each row will represent an Organization. In the context of the PHES-ODM, metadata is anything that gives information that is not found in the templates related to Measures, Protocols and Samples.

You can find additional information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns at the beginning of this guide ([1) How to use templates]) and <!--# link to definitions document -->

## Quick Start

Below you will find the fields that are mandatory for the metadata-related templates. You will also find some examples of entries of data, with the fields filled and colour-coded. A more detailed description of some of the key concepts can be found in the following section, Detailed Description.
