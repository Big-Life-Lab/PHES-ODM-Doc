# How to use the ODM {.unnumbered}

## 1) How to use templates

The main purpose of templates it to provide you with an easy way to enter in your wastewater data in the PHES-ODM format. Below you will find a series of Guides that will walk you through this process. To begin with, in these Guides, "field" refers to a column in the template, and "entry" refers to a row of information that you entered. While these Guides will also provide definitions and explanations for some terms, most can be found here <!--# link and/or provide title to page with definitions -->..

The templates contain four main types of fields and, in the Guides, they have been associated with a colour for instructional purposes:

-   **Identifier, Unique Identifier and Composite Unique Identifer (Red):** In these types of fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, "Sample ID" is used to identify a particular Sample. <!--# I decided to capitalize all terms that refer to anything associated with a field (such as in this case, a sample). I'm not sure if this works... -->In an Identifier, these values can be repeated between entries, while in a Unique Identifier, they cannot. There is usually only one Unique Identifier per template. A Composite Unique Identifier is a type of Unique Identifier formed by two or more fields. An example can be found in colums A and B below, where while there is repetition in A and B, there is no repetition in the combination of the two. <!--# I'm not sure if you want an example with more relevant entries -->

![](/assets/how-to/composite-ex.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Drop-down and Conditional Drop-down Menus (Green):** These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that can be entered. These valuess can be selected **or** typed in. In conditional drop-down menus, the valuess depend on what you entered in a previous field.

-   **Free form (Blue):** In these fields, there are no restrictions on how to enter your data.

## 2) How to record a protocol

When analyzing data from various sources, it is important to understand how the data was produced. The PHES-ODM recognizes this and includes protocols as one of its entities. To store protocols efficiently in database tables, several challenges must be addressed:

1\. Protocols are comprised of a collection of steps.

2\. Protocol steps can consist of two entries:

-   They can prescribe the use of a specific quantity of something. This can be described using the different measures found in the PHES-ODM dictionary and assigning them a prescribed value and unit of measurement.

-   They can prescribe an action. The PHES-ODM calls this a method.

3\. Protocol steps must be organised in the right order to convey the meaning of the protocol.

4\. Steps may follow each other, or they can be done concurrently.

5\. Measures found inside a protocol specify the quantity of reagents, supplies and conditions involved in the realization of a method.

6\. Different protocols may use some of the same steps, but in a different order.

7\. Protocols may have steps that consist in one or several (sub)protocols.

8\. Protocols can be updated with new versions, or they can reference and build from other protocols.

To solve these constraints, the PHES-ODM stores a protocol (e.g., what it does, who developed it, when it was developed) separately from its constituent steps. These protocol steps are stored in the \`Protocol Steps\` table. The entries in the steps table are either methods or measures.

The protocol steps are linked together in their own \`Protocol Relationships\` table. Rows in the relationship table have four main attributes. The first is the protocol identifier. The three other attributes define a relationship between two steps in the protocol. The relationship is expressed in the form:

\`subject → relationship → object\`

Where the subject and the object can either be a protocol step or subprotocol. The available relationships (e.g., \`is_before\`, \`specifies\`, \`is_concurrent_with\`, etc.) allows one to organize the protocol is a more semantically meaningful way than by simply using a sequential order.

This flexible structure allows protocol steps and subprotocols to be reused in any number of protocols. The relationships between protocols, protocol orderings, and protocol steps are shown in Figure A.

    ii) Column K:
        -   A Free Form field in which you will enter the Value of the Measure. If a Method is being entered, then you can put "NA" here.
    iii) Columns L and M:
         -   These are Conditional Drop-down Menu fields.

         -   Unit (column L) depends on what you entered in Measure ID (column C). If you entered a Method, then you can put "NA" in this field.
