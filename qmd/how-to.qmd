## How-To Guides

## 1) How to use templates

The main purpose of templates it to provide you with an easy way to convert your wastewater data into the PHES-ODM format. Below you will find a series of Guides that will walk you through these templates. To begin with, in these Guides, "field" refers to a column in the template, and "entry" refers to a row of information that you entered. While these Guides will also provide definitions and explanations for some terms, most can be found here <!--# link and/or provide title to page with definitions -->.

<!--# Is there somewhere where we indicate what order the templates/tables should be filled out?  That might be useful -->

The templates contain four main types of fields and, in the Guides, they have been associated with a colour for instructional purposes:

-   **Identifier, Unique Identifier and Composite Unique Identifer (Red):** In these types of fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, Sample ID is used to identify a particular Sample. <!--# I decided to capitalize all terms that refer to anything associated with a field (such as in this case, a sample). I'm not sure if this works or how it's being done in other sections -->An Identifier can be repeated between entries, while an Unique Identifier cannot. There is usually only one Unique Identifier per template. A Composite Unique Identifier is a type of Unique Identifier formed by two or more fields. An example can be found in colums A and B below, where while there is repetition in A and B, there is no repetition in the combination of the two. <!--# I'm not sure if you want an example with more relevant entries -->

![](assets/how-to/how-to/composite-ex.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Drop-down and Conditional Drop-down Menus (Green):** These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that you can either select **or** type in. In conditional drop-down menus, the values depend on what you entered in a previous field.

-   **Date Fields (Purple):** Dates that are associated with the entry will be entered in these fields. These dates must be in the form of dd/mm/yyyy. <!--# Is this the format that you want? -->

-   **Free Form Fields (Blue):** In these fields, there are minimal restrictions on how to enter your data. Any restrictions will be specified in the relevant sections.

## 2) How to report Protocols, Protocol Steps and Protocol Relationships:

<!--# add link to youtube video -->

In this guide you will learn how to enter Protocols, Procotol Steps and Protocol Relationships into their respective templates. As described in <!--# title of document and link-->, a Protocol is "A procedure for collecting a sample or performing a measure". Each entry in the Protocols Template represents a unique Protocol. A Protocol is made up of Protocol Steps. In the Protocol Steps Template, each entry is one of these steps. Finally, Protocols and Protocols can be linked to each other. Each entry in the Protocol Relationships Template represents one of these relationships. For instance, the Protocols Steps that make up a particular Protocol will be specified in this template. <!--# is this correct? -->.

For further information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns that you will see, please refer to the beginning of this guide ([1) How to use templates]) and <!--# link to definitions document -->

## Quick Start

Below you will find the fields that are mandatory for the Protocols, Protocol Steps and Protocol Relationships templates.Â You will also find some examples of entries of data, with all of the fields filled and colour-coded.

    ![](assets/how-to/protSteps_col_AG.png){fig-align="center"}

    i)  Column A:
        -   Protocol Step ID (column A) is the Unique Identifier field for this template and cannot be repeated between entries. You can think of each Protocol Step ID value as representing a unique Protocol Step.
    ii) Columns B to C:
        -   These are Drop-down Menu fields.

        -   You only need to enter a value into Method ID (column B) or Measure ID (column C). The former is for when you are entering a Method as a Protocol Step. The latter is when you are entering a Measure as a Protocol Step. Leave the other field **blank**.
    iii) Columns D to G:
         -   These are Free Form fields and you can enter the relevant information in any format that you wish.
         -   Summary (column D) is a short description of the Protocol Step that you are entering.

        -   You can repeat values between entries. For instance, if you are entering two different Method Steps from the same Organization, then the Organization field (column H) will be the same.
    ii) Column K:
        -   A Free Form field in which you will enter the Value of the Measure. If a Method is being entered, then you can put "NA" here.
    iii) Columns L and M:
         -   These are Conditional Drop-down Menu fields.
         -   Unit (column L) depends on what you entered in Measure ID (column C). If you entered a Method, then you can put "NA" in this field.
         -   Aggregation (column M) depends on what you entered in Unit (column L). If you entered a Method, then you can put "NA" in this field.

        -   Protocol ID (column B) is the Unique Identifier for this template, and cannot be repeated between entries. In essence, each value of Protocol ID represents a unique Measure.
        -   For the rest, you can repeat the Identifier between entries (if needed). For instance, if you are entering two different Protocols from the same Dataset, then the Dataset ID (column C) will be the same.
        -   You may have already created these Identifiers in another template. For instance you may have created Dataset IDs in the Datasets Template.
    ii) Columns A, D to F:
        -   These are Free Form fields in which you can enter the indicated information.
        -   Source Protocol (column A) is where you can indicate the Protocol that served as the basis for the Protocol that is currently being entered.
        -   Name (column D) refers to the Name that you have decided to give your Protocol.

    ![](assets/how-to/protRel_col_AH.png){fig-align="center"}

    i)  Columns A to C, E and F:

        -   These are Identifier fields.

        -   All of these Identifiers are either Protocol IDs or Protocol Step IDs and represent Protocols and Protocol Steps, respectively. Note that neither of them are Unique Identifiers and, thus, can be repeated between entries.

        -   Protocol ID Container (column A) is the Identifier that represents a particular relationship.\

        -   You should only enter in a value for one of the two "Object" columns (column B and C); this depends on whether the Object of the relationship that you are entering is a Protocol or a Protocol Step. The same is true for the two "Subject" columns (column E and F).

        -   An example will be given in section (ii) below.

    ii) Columns D:

        -   This is a Drop-down Menu field, where you can select the type of relationship that is being entered.
        -   For example, say you wanted to enter in a relationship stating that a Protocol Step is part of a Protocol. You would enter the relevant Identifiers in the Protocol ID Object field (column B) and the Step ID Subject field (column F). You would then select " <!--# Not sure what to put here, I don't think that the Parts table contains this yet --> " from the Relationship field. Finally, to identify this relationship, you would enter in something in the Protocol ID Container field (column A)

    iii) Columns G and H:

         -   These are a Date field (column D) and a Free Form field (column E) where you can enter in the indicated information.

You have now entered your data in the Method Steps and Methods Sets Template, congratulations!

## 3) How to report Measures and Measure Sets:
