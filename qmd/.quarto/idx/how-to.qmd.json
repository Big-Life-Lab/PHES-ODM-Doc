The templates also serve as an interactive way to get to know the ODM and can be found at the OSF.io [PHES-ODM reference file folder](https://osf.io/ab9se/).\n\nThe guides below will walk you through each of the report templates. In these guides, \"field\" refers to a column in the template, and \"entry\" refers to a row of information that you entered. The guides also provide definitions and explanations for some terms; more complete information can be found in the Reference Guide - [Parts document](parts.qmd). If you have any questions or comments, you can post them on our [Discourse forum](https://odm.discourse.group).\n\nAs a starting point:\n\n-   `Sample report` and `Measure report` tables are used for day-to-day reporting. You can record information about a sample in the `Sample report` table. Measures (or measurements) are recorded in the `Measure report` table. A measure is \"measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance\".\n\n-   There are three optional tables that support the reporting of samples and measures:\n\n    -   `Sample relationships` is used only when you have samples that are pooled or split.\n\n    -   `Measure set report` can be used to link measures together.\n\n    -   `Quality reports` is used for detailed quality assurance and control reporting (you can, and should, record a quality flag attribute for each measure or sample in the `Measure report` and `Sample report` tables).\n\n-   Typically, there is a one time initial setup where you will need to enter information into the `Sites`, `Address`, `Organization`, and `Contact` tables.\n\n    -   `Sites` is mandatory and records information about where testing is performed.\n\n    -   `Address`, `Organization`, and `Contact` provide the contact information for sites and entities such as laboratories.\n\n-   There are optional supporting tables, such as `Protocols` and `Instrument`, where you can use the templates to record information about how samples are taken and how measures are reported. You only need to compete these tables once and then update them as needed. `Protocol steps` and `Protocol relationships` tables are used alongside the `Protocols` table. Other supporting tables include `Polygon`, which stores information about the sample shed, and `Dataset`, which stores information about the data custodian and owner of the data.\n\nThe templates contain four main types of fields; in these how-to guides they are colour-coded for instructional purposes:\n\n-   **Identifier and unique identifier (red):** In these fields you will create a value that will be used to identify something. For instance, `Sample ID` is used to identify each unique sample. An identifier can be repeated between entries, while an unique identifier cannot. There is usually only one unique identifier per template, and they correspond to the name of the template. For example, `Measure ID` for the `Measure report` template, and `Contact ID` for the `Contact` template.\n\n-   **Drop-down and conditional drop-down menus (green):** These fields have a drop-down menu which contain the values that you can either select **or** type in. In conditional drop-down menus, the values depend on what you entered in a previous field.\n\n-   **Date fields (purple):** Dates are entered in these fields and must be in the form of the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html \"https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\") format: `yyyy-mm-dd`. All date fields also support entries for hours, minutes, and seconds: `2022-01-01T06:11:54` and `2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30`\n\n-   **Free form fields (blue):** In these fields, you can enter your data in any format that you wish. Any restrictions will be specified in the relevant sections. Keep in mind, different measures may have different data types that cannot be validated in Excel. The data type of a measure can be checked in the reference list for the measure. For example, the data type for [Sample temperature](parts.qmd#temp\") is a real number.\n\n### Conditional menus\n\nConditional menus use the FILTER function (which is present in Excel 2019 and later) and are only functional in the first three rows of their respective templates. In addition, the auto-calculation has been disabled. Thus, you will need to press the \"Calculate Sheet\" button, which is in the \"Formulas\" tab after entering the value in the field upon which the conditional menu is based upon; this button is outlined in red in the image below (the image is for Excel Online). For example, for the `Measure` conditional menu in the `Measure report` template, you would select a value in the `Class` field, press \"Calculate Sheet\" and then the correct values will show up in the menu of the `Measure` field.\n\n![](assets/how-to/cond_menu.png)\n\nAll of this was done because, in an online environment (such as Excel Online), the code for the conditional menus work can cause the templates to run very slowly. You can reactivate the auto-calculation if you wish. For further information about how to expand these menus to additional rows and other aspects of the templates, see [Notes regarding templates].\n\n## 2) How to report Measures and Measure sets\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to record data in the `Measure report` (or `measures` Excel tab) and `Measure set report` (or `measureSets` tab) templates. In the `Measure report` template, each row represents a measure. Along the same lines, in the `Measure set report` template, each entry represents a collection or set of measures.\n\nYou can find additional information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns at the beginning of this document ([How-To guides]) and the Reference Guide - [Parts document]((parts.qmd)).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nBelow you will find the mandatory fields for the `Measure report` and `Measure set report` templates. You will also find definitions of these fields and examples of entries of data. A more detailed description of some of the key concepts can be found in the following section, Detailed description.\n\n### `Measure report` template\n\n1.  **Mandatory fields**\n\n-   **`Report ID`**: Unique identifier for the `Measure report` template. Each value represents a measure.\n\n-   **`Sample ID`**: Identifier for the sample that is associated with each measure.\n\n-   **`Site ID`**: Identifier for the location where a sample was taken.\n\n-   **`Analysis Date End`**: Date the measure was completed.\n\n-   **`Measure`**: A measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substances.\n\n-   **`Value`**: Value of the measure.\n\n-   **`Unit`**: Units of a value.\n\n-   **`Aggregation`**: Statistical measure that the measure represents (for example \"mean\").\n\n-   **`Specimen`**: Substance or thing upon which the observation was made. Specimens include `Population`, `Sample`, and `Site`. This field is only mandatory if there is more than one specimen type that is collected in the dataset.\n\n2.  **Examples**\n\n    *Image will be added*\n\n### **Measure Sets Template**\n\n1.  **Mandatory fields**\n\n-   **`Report set ID`**: Unique identifier for the `Measure set report` template. Each value represents a group of related measures.\n\n3.  **Examples**\n\n    *Image will be added.*\n\n## Detailed description\n\n### **Measures template**\n\n1.  **Columns A to H**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/measures_Col_AH.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"679\"}\n\n    i)  Columns A-C, and E-H\n\n        -   These are identifier fields.\n\n        -   `Report ID` (column A) is the unique identifier for this template, and it cannot be repeated. You can think of each `Report ID` as representing a unique measure. The field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\n\n        -   You can repeat the other fields between entries (if needed). For instance, if you enter two different measures from the same sample, then the `Sample ID` (column C) will be the same.\n\n        -   You may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance, you may have created `Sample ID` in the `Sample report` template.\n\n    ii) Column D\n\n        -   `Purpose` has a drop-down menu. If you are unsure what to put, select `Regular`.\n\n2.  **Columns I to M**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/measures_Col_IM.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n    i)  Columns I to K\n        -   These are date fields where you can enter the dates associated with your measure in the format yyyy-mm-dd. Including hours and minutes is optional, but all date-entries use the ISO 8601 format. `2022-01-01T06:11:54` or `2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30`\n    ii) Columns L and M\n        -   `Specimen` and `Fraction analyzed` have drop-down menus. In general both fields are optional, but both are recommended (see next point for the exception).\n        -   `Specimen` is mandatory when the data you are entering has more than one type of specimen. When there is only one specimen, the `Dataset` table records the specimen type. For example, if your `Measure report` table includes only wastewater sample measures, you can indicate this information in the `Dataset` table.\n        -   `Fraction analyzed` applies only for water and wastewater samples. You should record the fraction for all samples if the compartment type is water or wastewater.\n\n3.  **Columns N to S**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/measures_Col_NS.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n    i)  Columns N and O\n        -   `Group` and `Class` help organize the `Measure` field by making specific measures easier to find (see the example in the next section). Both fields have a drop-down menu and are optional.\n\n        -   Leave these fields **blank** if you do not use them.\n    ii) Column P\n        -   `Measure` is where you select what is being measured. A measure in ODM is a \"measurement or observation of any substance including a biological, physical or chemical substance\".\n\n        -   `Measure` has a conditional drop-down menu. If you chose to enter in a `Class` (column O), the drop down menu will contain the `Measures` found in that `Class`. As mentioned, you can also enter a value into `Group` to help organize everything. If you did not enter a value in column O, the menu will contain all possible measures.\n\n        -   For example, to find the allele measures for SARS-CoV-2 you can start by selecting `SARS-CoV-2` in the `Group` column. Next, you select `Alleles` in the `Class` field. Then, in the drop-down menu of the `Measure` field, you will see all the possible measures that contain SARS-CoV-2 allele regions.\n\n            ![](assets/how-to/group-class-Col_NO.png){width=\"503\"}\n    iii) Column Q\n         -   `Value` is where you enter the value of your measure. For instance, if you recorded an `Environmental temperature` of 20 ^o^C, you would enter \"20\".\n\n         -   Note: While the value you enter into this field can be of any data type, each measure is associated with a specific one. Data types for each measure can be found in the reference documentation. For example, the data type for `Environmental temperature` can be found [here](parts.qmd#airTemp).\n    iv) Column R\n        -   `Unit` is where you enter the unit of your measure. This is a conditional drop-down menu field that lists all units that are valid for what was entered in the `Measure` field. For example, if selected `Environmental temperature` in the `Measure` field, the only unit displayed is `Celsius`.\n    v)  Column S\n        -   `Aggregations` is where you enter the aggregation of your value using a drop-down menu. For instance, does your value represent a mean, median, etc.\n\n        -   What appears in this menu list depends on what you entered in the `Unit` field (column R).\n\n4.  **Columns T to AB**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/measures_Col_TAB.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n    i)  Columns U, V, Z and AB\n        -   These are free-form fields.\n        -   `Index` (column U) is used if you have multiple entries with the same values in most of the other fields; an example is when you make replicates of measures. If this is the case you can enter \"1\", \"2\", etc. in this field to differentiate them.\n        -   `Measure license` (column V) refers to the access and use licensing of the measure that you are entering.\n    ii) Column T and W\n        -   These are fields which contain drop-down menus.\n        -   `Reportable` (column W) is where you can indicate if the measure should not be used for regular reporting due to quality concerns. You can record more details of the quality concerns in the `Quality reports` template.\n    iii) Column X and Y\n         -   These are identifier fields that are used to indicate the organization and contact person associated with the entry.\n    iv) Column AA\n        -   `Last edited` is where you can indicate the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\n### **`Measure set report` template**\n\n1.  **Columns A to G**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/measureSets_Col_AG.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"671\"}\n\n    i)  Columns A, B, D and E\n\n        -   These are identifier fields.\n\n        -   `Report Set ID` (column A) is the unique identifier for this template, and cannot be repeated between entries. In essence, each value of `Report set ID` represents a unique measure set. This field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\n\n        -   For the rest, you can repeat the identifier between entries (if needed). For instance, if you are entering two different measure sets that came from the same organization, then the `Organization ID` (column D) will be the same.\n\n        -   You may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance you may have created `Organization ID` in the `Organization` template.\n\n        Columns C and G\n\n        -   These are free form fields in which you can enter the indicated information. `Name` (column C) refers to the name that you have given to the measure set.\n\n    ii) Column F\n\n        -   `Last edited` is a date field in which you can enter the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\nYou have now entered your data in the `Measure report` and `Measure set report` templates, congratulations!\n\n## 3) How to report samples and sample relationships:\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to enter information about samples and sample relationships into their respective templates. In the `Sample report` (or `samples` tab) template, each entry represents a sample. A sample is the wastewater that you collected so that measures can be made. Along the same lines, each entry in the `Sample relationships` (or`sampleRelationships`) template represents an interaction (or relationship) between two samples in the form \"subject - relationship - object\". So, to specify that Sample A is a field sample replicate of Sample B, you would enter `Sample ID` of A - `Field sample replicate` - `Sample ID` of B.\n\nYou can find additional information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns at the beginning of this document ([How-To guides]) and the Reference Guide - Parts document.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nBelow you will find the fields that are mandatory for the `Sample report` and `Sample relationships` templates. You will also find definitions of these fields and examples of entries of data. A more detailed description of some of the key concepts can be found in the following section, Detailed Description.\n\n### Samples Template\n\n1.  **Mandatory fields**\n\n-   **`Sample ID`**: Unique identifier for the `Sample report` template. Each value represents a sample.\n\n-   **`Site ID`**: Identifier for the location where a sample was taken.\n\n-   **`Sample material`**: Type of material that the sample is made of.\n\n-   **`Sample collection type`**: Method used to collect the sample.\n\n-   **`Collection period`**: The time period over which the sample was collected, in hours.\n\n-   **`Collection number`**: The number of subsamples that were combined to create the sample. Use NA for continuous, proportional or passive sampling.\n\n-   **`Collection date time`**: The date, time and time zone the sample was taken.\n\n2.  **Examples**\n\n    *Image will be added*\n\n### Sample Relationships Template\n\n1.  **Mandatory fields**\n\n-   **`Sample ID object`**: The object (or one of the samples) of a relationship between two samples. This will always be a `Sample ID` that was previously created in the `Sample report` template.\n\n-   **`Relationship`**: Describes the relationship between two samples.\n\n-   **`Sample ID subject`**: The subject (or one of the samples) of a relationship between two samples. This will always be a `Sample ID` that was previously created in the `Sample report` template.\n\n2.  **Examples**\n\n    *Image will be added*\n\n## Detailed Description\n\n### `Sample report` template\n\n1.  **Columns A to G**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/samples_Col_AG.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n    i)  Columns A to E:\n\n        -   These are identifier fields.\n\n        -   `Sample ID` (column A) is the unique identifier for this template and cannot be repeated between entries. You can think of each `Sample ID` value as representing a unique sample. This field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\n\n        -   For the rest of the fields, you can repeat values between entries. For instance, if you are entering two different samples from the same site, then the `Site ID` (column E) will be the same.\n\n        -   You may have already created these identifiers in another template. For instance you may have created `Site ID` in the `Sites` template.\n\n    ii) Columns F to G:\n\n        -   These are fields that contain drop-down menus where you can enter information regarding the `Purpose` (column F) and `Sample material` (column G) of your sample.\n\n2.  **Columns H to O**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/samples_Col_HO.png)\n\n    i)  Columns H:\n        -   `Dataset ID` is an identifier field for the dataset that your sample is associated with.\n    ii) Columns I to K, O:\n        -   These fields contain drop-down menus and are related to various characteristics of your sample.\n\n        -   `Sample collection type` (column K) refers to the collection technique you used to obtain the sample.\n\n        -   `Pooled` (column O) refers to whether or not the sample that you are entering is made up of multiple child samples.\n    iii) Columns L to N:\n         -   These are free form fields.\n         -   `Collection period` (column L) refers to the number of hours that you took to collect the sample.\n         -   `Collection number` (column M) refers to the number of subsamples that were used to create Sample that you are entering.\n         -   `Collection number and period` (column N) is a combination of the previous two fields.\n\n3.  **Columns P to W**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/samples_Col_PW.png)\n\n    i)  Columns P to T, V:\n        -   These are date fields that are related to your sample. These dates will be in the format yyyy-mm-dd. Including hours and minutes is optional, but all date-entries use the ISO 8601 format. `2022-01-01T06:11:54` or `2022-01-01T06:11:54+13:30.`\n        -   `Last edited` is where you can enter the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n    ii) Column U and W:\n        -   `Reportable` (column U) is a drop-down menu field where you can indicate if the sample should not be used for regular reporting due to quality concerns.

This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the entry was entered with no updates.\n\nYou have now entered your data in the `Sample report` and `Sample relationships` templates, congratulations!\n\n## 4) How to report protocols, protocol steps and protocol relationships:\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to enter protocols, protocol steps and protocol relationships into their respective templates. A protocol is \"A procedure for collecting a sample or performing a measure\". Each entry in the `Protocols` (or `protocols`) template represents a unique protocol. A protocol is made up of protocol steps. In the `Protocol steps` (or `protocolSteps`) template, each entry is one of these steps. Finally, protocols and protocol steps can be linked to each other. Each entry in the `Protocol relationships` (or `protocolRelationships`) template represents one of these relationships in the form, \"subject - relationship - object\". So, for example, if you want to specify that Protocol step A needs to be done before Protocol step B, you would enter the `Protocol step ID` of A - `Is Before` - `Protocol Step ID` of B.\n\nYou can find additional information regarding terms and the colour-coding of columns at the beginning of this guide ([How-To guides]) and the Reference Guide - Parts document.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nBelow you will find the fields that are mandatory for the `Protocols`, `Protocol steps` and `Protocol relationships` templates. You will also find definitions of these fields and examples of entries of data.

You can think of each `Protocol Step ID` value as representing a unique protocol step. This field can be any combination of letters or words up to 30 characters.\n        -   `Protocol step source` (column E) specifies the protocol step that you used as a basis for the given protocol step (it will be a previous `Protocol step ID`).\n    ii) Columns B to C:\n        -   These are fields with drop-down menus.\n\n        -   You only need to enter a value into `Method` (column B) or `Measure` (column C). The former is for when you are entering a method as a protocol step. The latter is when you are entering a measure as a protocol step. Leave the other field **blank**.\n    iii) Columns D, F and G:\n         -   These are free form fields.\n         -   `Summary` (column D) is a short description of the protocol step that you are entering.\n         -   `Protocol step version` (column F) specifies the version of a given protocol step.\n\n2.  **Columns H to O**\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/protSteps_Col_HO.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n    i)  Columns H to J:\n        -   These are identifier fields.\n        -   You can repeat values between entries. For instance, if you are entering two different protocol steps from the same organization, then the `Organization ID` field (column H) will be the same.\n    ii) Column K:\n        -   `Value` is a free form field where, if the protocol step is a measure, you can enter its value.\n    iii) Columns L and M:\n         -   These fields contain conditional drop-down menu fields.\n         -   `Unit` (column L) depends on what you entered in `Measure` (column C). This field is only applicable if the protocol step is a measure.\n         -   `Aggregation` (column M) depends on what you entered in `Unit` (column L).

This includes `Protocol ID Container` (column A), which is a `Protocol ID` that contains the relationships that you are entering in this template. Note that none of these fields are unique identifiers and, thus, they can be repeated between entries.\n\n        -   You should only enter a value for one of the two `object` columns (column B and C); this depends on whether the object of the relationship that you are entering is a protocol or a protocol step. The same is true for the two `subject` columns (column E and F).\n\n        -   An example will be given in point (ii) below.\n\n    ii) Columns D:\n\n        -   `Relationship` contains a drop-down menu; it is where you can select the type of relationship that is being entered.\n        -   For example, pretend you wanted to enter a relationship stating that Protocol step A takes place before Protocol step B in a particular protocol container. You would enter the relevant identifiers in the `Step ID Object` field (column B) and the `Step ID subject` field (column F). You would then select `Is Before` from the `Relationship` field. Finally, to identify this relationship, you would enter in the identifier in the `Protocol ID Container` field (column A)\n\n    iii) Columns G and H:\n\n         -   These are a date field (column G) and a free form field (column H) where you can enter in the indicated information.\n         -   `Last edited` (column G) is where you can enter the date when the entry was last updated. This field is used when you modify an entry after your initial recording. Leave this field blank if the measure was entered with no updates.\n\nYou have now entered your data in the `Protocol steps`, `Protocols` and `Protocol relationships` templates, congratulations!\n\n## 5) How to report metadata\n\nIn this guide you will learn how to enter in the metadata of your wastewater data through a series of templates.

Unlike the main template, the rows containing the code will not be alternating in colour.\n\n-   The code is only present for the first three rows. If you want to use conditional menus for additional rows, you will need to copy the code to these rows as well as create the menus in the desired cells. As an example, pretend that you wanted to add a `Measure` field conditional menu to row 5 in the `Measure report` template. The first thing you would do is copy the code from AF4 to AF5 (see below, all images in this example are from Excel Online).\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/ccond_menu.png)\n\n-   Then, to create the new menu, you would go to P5 (which is where the new conditional menu will be located). You would select \"Data validation\", which is under \"Data Tools\" in the \"Data\" tab (it is outlined in red in the image below).\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/ccond_menu2.png)\n\n-   Finally, you would select \"List\" from the \"Allow\" menu and then enter the following text \"=\\$AF\\$5#\" under \"Source\". The column and row indicators (\"AF\" and \"5\", in this example) match up with where you copied the new code (\"AF5\").\n\n    ![](assets/how-to/ccond_menu3.png)\n\n    For additional menus, repeat the above steps. Adding conditional menus in an online environment (such as Excel Online) may slow down the templates considerably.\n\n#### Troubleshooting conditional menus\n\n-   The conditional menus work by searching the `partLabels` column in the `parts` table that is included with the templates.\n\n-   If you obtained an error with these menus check if any changes were made to the `parts` table.\n\n### Templates with menus (all templates other than the `Measure sets`, `Protocols`, `Contact`, `Address` and `Dataset` templates)\n\n#### Part IDs\n\n-   In the main parts of each of the templates, labels are used in the menus.\n\n-   If you wish to have the part IDs of these values, they are located to the right of the main template and, if applicable, the code for the conditional menus. Unlike the main template, the rows containing the part IDs will not be alternating in colour.\n\n-   The part IDs are present in the first 100 rows of each of the templates.\n\n#### Troubleshooting
