# Parts 
 Parts are the smallest way of describing anything in the ODM. Think of the example of parts of a car. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car -- right down to every nut and bolt. The same is true for the ODM. 
 The ODM has a part ID (partID) and part description (partDescription) for every measure, method and attribute. There are also partIDs for measure categories, units, aggregations, and other parts. Below is the part list.

Numbers are allowed but there no other special characters other than `_`. `_` is a reserved character that is used to generate a partID using a compoent or table attributes. A partID for a subComponent is automatically generated using attributes of a component. For example, the partID for the compoent `SARS-CoV-2` is `covid`. `Covid` can have many subComponents including different groups (Covid-19-al, Covid-19-va, ovid-pr (allele, variant or protein) or units and aggregatrions (i.e. covid-al-N1-mean-cpl representing ovid allele N1, mean observation of viral copies per litre of effluent).

For example, a wastewater measure was repeated later with an improved method. You can revise the entry by updating the value and then adding the date the new measure was performed to 'lastEdited'.  To ensure data provenance, the best practice in this example is to generate a new entry with the same measureID as the original measureID. The original and new measures are kept in the database with a date in the 'lastEdited' field for the new entry but not the original one. Some databases may choose a delete-and-replace approach where the original entry is deleted and replaced by a new entry.
