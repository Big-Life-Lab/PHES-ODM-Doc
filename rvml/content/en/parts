# Parts <br /> Parts are the smallest way of describing anything in the ODM. Think of the example of parts of a car. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car -- right down to every nut and bolt. The same is true for the ODM. <br /> The ODM has a part ID (partID) and part description (partDescription) for every measure, method and attribute. There are also partIDs for measure categories, units, aggregations, and other parts. Below is the part list.

```{rvml}```
var versionText = Version first released:
var updateText = Version last updated:

var tableRow = {<a name="{{partID}}">**{{partLabel}}**</a> partID:({{partID}})<br />{{partDesc}},<br /> partInstr_%, {{partInstr_%}}," <br /> partType_%,{{partType_%}}, "<br />status_%, {{status_%}}, versionText ,{{firstReleased}} updateText, {{lastUpdated}},"<br /> dataType_%, {{dataType_%}}}

var test_list = {<a href="#{{partID}}">**{{partLabel}}**</a> <br />}


{{filter:*, order:label = ASC ,format(tableRow)}}

```{rvml}```
